								They smote the creatures easily one by one as they came out of the hole, but little did they know these were only infant kitins, and suddenly, from a gaping
								hole in the wall came a horde of great kitin soldiers.

								The alert was raised and the mayor of Coriolis mustered up  a fighting force.\n
								But horror met their eyes on the horizon as they were just leaving the town.\n
								In the distance, a legion of great kitins was coming up fast so marking the start of the Great Swarming and the end of an Empire.\n
								To this day, many believe that the kitins were protecting some hidden secret of Atys.
								This is the end of the story.\n

								There was no time to lose, the wind could change direction at any moment and carry the Fyros scent to the kitin armies that were at present travelling south.\n
								Nemys knew the land like the back of his hand and, true to his word, led the multitude wisely to the Ridge of Baldos where, sure enough, there stood the
								rainbow of Elias which took them far away to the Prime Roots on another land.\n
								But little did Nemys know that there could be no return once through the rainbow.\n

								But how to bring them back? To bring anyone back is to find them first!\n
								Again the answer came from the sky, this time at night.\n
								Throughout his life travels Nemys had developed a love for stargazing and could tell where the clusters would appear according to the season.\n
								In this way he concluded that the Prime Root sanctuary must be situated far to the west of the ancient lands even though many thought they were to the east,

							Je ne tiens pas à ce qu'ils s'approchent de la ville et sèment le désordre, ou pire. J'ai donc décidé d'envoyer
