	And knowing him like I do, he would never tell me his secret as he thinks I'm not a true mushroom lover because I use them to craft items instead of eating them. Usually you can find him around $arena.da$ $arena$ west of $town$, and please be gentle with him, he's just a stubborn old man.]

						of <**$mushroom$**> that can be found in <**$davae$**>, just behind the weapon merchant's building.\n\n

	{break}The vector is us, homins ! I recently found another spot of exotic mushrooms in the northwest corner of the terraces, here in $arena.da$ $arena$.

						If you want to teleport you will always be safer with a Karavan Guardian who, I might add, will not infringe on your 
						liberty of thinking as will a Kamis. I wouldn't trust a Kami as far as I could throw one. Their excessive concern for 
						the environment is all for the love of their own well-being. Where were they during the Great Swarming while the Karavan 
						were doing everything in their power to try to get things back under control ?\n\n
						By the way, I've heard that $target$ was seen talking to a kami last week. As he's a guard, we mustn't let this incident 
						bring on the wrath of Jena. Could you please ask him if this is true ?]

						no doubt keeping themselves to themselves till enough of us were slaughtered, but then as soon as the tide of battle 
						was turning they were everywhere, directing homins through the rainbows, probably so we'd be eternally grateful to them

						Karavan they'd be kicking us about like daft <**$yubo.p$**>, getting us to fight the Goo for them for free.]
