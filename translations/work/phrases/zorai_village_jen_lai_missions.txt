							So, one autumn, the great bells tolled unexpectedly...\n
							My father's first fear was that the barbarians in the north had somehow escaped our guards attention, 
							found a blind spot in the great wall securing our territory and had launched an attack. He swept me 
							off my feet while my mother took my baby brother and we sped home as the city doors where being 
							banging shut. When he left us to stand ready with his guild I had a pang in the heart and wouldn't 
							let go of his leg. He nearly became cross and my mother had to pull me away. I watched him from the 
							window run down the road toward the main entrance, skinning knife in hand. I had a sinking feeling 
							I would never see him again.\n
							Il est temps de faire notre première offrande. Ce sera la dague, en mémoire de tous les guerriers 
							tombés ce jour-là.]

							Outside there was a tremendous crash followed by a sudden movement of the crowd and people started 
							shouting and screaming that monsters were upon us. There was another sickening bang and a rolling 
							of dust as the towers and the city wall collapsed.\n
							We watched the scene from our upper terrace and through the dust we saw the first giant $kitin.p$ 
							clambering into the city. Mother grabbed me, we ran downstairs, "pour the trapper liquid over 
							yourself, quick, it'll cover your scent!" she cried as she dowsed my brother and herself. We 
							poured a whole container over the floor then lifted the cellar trapdoor and descended to where my 
							father did his skinning, and it was none too late neither.\n

							A thousand feet drummed past the upper cellar window that looked onto the street at ground level. 
							An obnoxious smell then filled the air as on the floor above our heads we heard some dreadful 
							scratching about. My mother held my hand over my mouth for the first five minutes in anticipation 
							of my screams, I was petrified. And then the rummaging above our heads got louder...\n
							My mother made signs for me not to make a sound, and I did my best to swallow my sobs for my father 
							who must have been killed. Then there was fierce banging on the door and this time I couldn't help 
							let out a frightened yelp. My mother put her hand over my mouth again as upstairs all movement 
							ceased, there was a kind of electric sound and I knew the monster was searching the air for sound 
							vibrations. I swear my heart beat so fast and so loud that I was sure the monster could hear it!\n

							But then the sound of rummaging moved away, the creepy-crawly steps were leaving our house, and I 
							collapsed in my mother's arms. I don't know how long we slept maybe four hours, all I remember is 
							that outside it was getting dark when I awoke my little brother giggling at a moth. My mother sat 
							bolt upright from her slumber and hushed him for fear of kitins nearby. But though we couldn't see 
							out of the window for the dust and dimness, we felt that all was quiet about. We cautiously took 
							our first steps on the creaky cellar steps leading to the trapdoor in the floor. As my mother 
							turned the handle there was a sudden awful clamor outside the door and this time I couldn't keep 
							in my cries. My mother barely had time to sweep both me and my brother up in her arms...\n

							The door was thrust open and there stood a tall silhouette that I knew peering down at us : my father! 
							He pulled all of us out in one lump and squeezed us in his great arms. It was then on looking round 
							that I realized that our house and our neighbors' houses, the whole city was in ruins like after a 
							wild flow of water. He had made it to the house of a fellow guildsman when the kitins broke through 
							the wall, he pushed the whole family down into the cellar where they were waiting for us now. He 
							told us how he had done as he had often told my mother to do in case we were besieged by beasts 
							when we lived in the country. My father told us later that it was the only way to escape as many 
							had died fleeing at the other end of town where the doors were not wide enough, many were trampled 
							under foot before the kitins even got to them. It is for this that our villages today have no walls.]
