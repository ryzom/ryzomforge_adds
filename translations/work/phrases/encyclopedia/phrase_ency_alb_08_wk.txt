	[Numerous tribes have sworn allegiance to the Karavan, the most active being the Kuild. The Kuild tribe was first established in the old lands by the Karavan themselves to ensure Jena's Law was not violated. The Kuild was reformed in 2483 after the kitin war when homins resurfaced from their Prime Root sanctuary in the newfound lands.\n
			\n
			Members are chosen on the strength of their faith in Jena. Nowadays their camp lies in the Nexus and their official role is to represent the Karavan in the Prime Roots, and keep an eye on homin comings and goings there. They are then the eyes and ears of the Karavan.\n
			\n
			Other fervent pro-Karavan tribes include : the Black Circle, found all over Atys with their base camp located in Witherings; the Masters of the Goo and the Antikami based in the Witherings; the Smugglers and the Silt Sculptors living in tryker islands; the Matisian Border Guards, Darkening Sap, Sap Slaves and the Slash and Burn all found in Verdant Heights. A Karavan ambassador is posted in each one of these tribes.\n
			\n
			There are other pro-karavan tribes, but they're less close to the Jena's disciples than the above tribes.\n
			\n
			The Karavan struggles against the proliferation of pro-Kami tribes by sending in faithful homins to battle against them. The most hostile of these enemy tribes include: the Company of the Eternal Tree, found all over Atys; the Tutors in the Witherings; the Ancient Dryads, Ecowarriors and Sacred Sap situated in Verdant Heights; the Recoverers in the Nexus; and the Sap Gleaners and Cockroaches who reside in the Prime Roots.]
