	[Majestic Garden is situated on the continent of Verdant Heights. It takes its name from the beautiful gardens near the ancient capital of Matia. These gardens were elaborated under the reign of King Noblis and composed one of the wonders of the ancient world. After two years of Prime Root confinement, it was no wonder that Majestic Garden were the first words that came into King Yasson's head on beholding the enchanted forest likened to that of his cherished homelands. \n
			\n
			The new capital was soon established and named after the new born Matis Prince, Yrkanis, as a symbol of renaissance. Added to this came the villages of Davae, Natae and Avalae, named after the first three female babies born in the Matis colony of the Verdant Heights. The region also shelters a single outpost.\n
			\n
			Years of Matis presence has made this forest one of the safest on Atys, safe enough for the novice to begin to cut his or her teeth. That said, Majestic Gardens harbors a host of potentially dangerous animals including the ragus, yubo, <**bodoc,**> capryni and the gingo. The only species of kitin present in the region is the kipee, a peaceful herbivore which can be observed munching away at the lush vegetation. Among the flora, the most spectacular is the gathering of psykopla plants clustered on a mound and bound to intrigue the inquisitive eye.\n
			\n
			Another interesting feature is the arena where homins come to match their might and wit, and near which the merchant tribe of the Green Seed (the only tribe in the region) often sets up camp.\n
			\n
			Being one of the first regions of the newfound lands to be cleared, Majestic Garden benefits from a judicious network of bollards that sprout from the ground. These bollards mark the way between town and village allowing the wayward traveler to quickly pick up the lost track.\n
			\n
			Alters of the venerated Karavan will be found inside towns and villages. Kamis have a single alter established outside the capital.]

{
	[The Cities of Intuition was the first region of the Witherings to be secured by the Zoraïs after their two year reclusion in the Prime Roots. It was the great sage Fung-Tun who, after receiving a perception as to where to establish communion with spirits of the ancient world, conveyed the right to build the Zoraï city there.\n
			\n
			The capital city Zora was raised in memory of the multitudes who lost their lives during the kitin invasion of the ancient capital, Zoran. There then followed the construction of the three villages. Min-Cho and Hoï-Cho took their names from two great spiritual leaders whose successive reigns bridged the gulf between the dynasties of the old lands and the new. Min-Cho lost his life during the Great Swarming in the ancient lands, Hoï-Cho became first Zoraï leader of the newfound lands. Jen-Laï was built in the name of Jena for her delivering the Zoraï survivors to the new lands of promise.\n
			\n
			Still under the trauma of the great kitin invasion, the Zoraïs purposely built these first settlements of the Witherings into hollows of the bark to allow better defense in case of kitin attack. Between the villages of Min-Cho and Hoï-Cho, the traveler may come upon a camp of a crafter tribe, known as the Icon Worshippers, the only one pertaining to the region. The region also shelters a single outpost.\n
			\n
			This jungle land, being the first to be cleared by the Zoraïs, is a relatively safe zone where novice adventurers may put their skills to a fair test. The only species of kitin present in the area is the kipee, a relatively peaceful herbivore if left alone. Other wild animals include the javing, ragus, yubo, izam and the mektoub. The traveler will also watch out for the slaveni, the only intelligent plant in the region.\n
			\n
			Alters of the revered Kamis will be found inside towns and villages. A Karavan alter is kept outside the capital.]

	[The Imperial Dunes is situated on the continent of the Burning Desert. It was the first region of the newfound lands to be colonized by the Fyros after resurfacing from a two-year stint in the Prime Roots. Imperial scouts were the first Fyros to be sent out to locate a suitable site for the cremation of the embalmed body of Cerakos II, who died two years earlier during the Great Swarming, and whose spirit is now said to watch over the Dunes.\n
			\n
			The capital city of Pyr was established on the site of an oasis surrounded by three acid seams which spit forth fire. These fire holes now constitute the entrance points of Pyr, and it was on one of these points, to the east of the city, that Cerakos was lifted to the upper regions from his funeral pyre. Pyr is, without doubt, the most impressive homin city of the newfound lands with its great halls of learning attracting homins of every race from far and wide, as did the ancient capital of Fyr in its time. The region also shelters a single outpost generally occupied by the Leviers, the only tribe of the region.\n
			\n
			Years of Fyros presence has made this desert land one of the safest on Atys, safe enough for novices to begin to work their way up through the ranks of their office. The only kitin found in the Imperial Dunes to stir up the Emperor's spirit is the kipee, a relatively inoffensive specimen if left alone and worth preserving for its valued resources. Further to this, the Imperial Dunes harbors a host of potentially dangerous animals including the gingo, goari, capryni and the yubo. The shooki, a spitting plant, is the only native intelligent plant of the region.\n
			\n
			<**Alter**> of the Kamis will be found inside the city. Karavan <**alter is**> established outside the southern wall.]

	[The region of Liberty Lake consists of a myriad of lakes and lagoons situated on the continent of Aeden Aqueous. This was the first lake district Trykers came upon after two years of underground confinement in the Prime Roots. The name was given by Tryker sages not only to reflect the general sensation of new liberation, but also as "a constant reminder to all those who would dare harbor thoughts that would infringe on the Tryker fundamental values of freedom for all and all for freedom." Superstitious Trykers believe to this day that the mere evocation of the name in the mouth of a potential aggressor would distance any intention of suppression.\n
			\n
			A first new settlement was naturally outlined in the paradisiacal lands and arose to become the new aptly named Tryker capital of Fairhaven. Three villages, whose names are equally reminiscent of Tryker values, also flourish in the region. Crystabell, where crystalline waters flow; Windermeer, known for its windy tops and wind turbines; and Avendale, seated in the beautiful valley east of the capital. Liberty lake also shelters as many as six outposts where the Corsairs, the only tribe in the region, take refuge.\n
			\n
			Being the first area of the Lake Lands to be explored by Trykers, Liberty Lake is consequently the safest of the continent where the young Tryker novice is able to learn the ropes and get to grips with improving skills. But the region is not devoid of danger and the traveler may come across many potentially lethal wild creatures such as the goari, clopper, yubo, yber and the messab. The only kitin found in the area is the kipee, harmless if unprovoked and providing useful raw materials if hunted. The stinga plant is the region's only native intelligent plant.\n
			\n
			Alters of the venerated Karavan will be found inside the capital of Fairhaven and situated at the entrances of the villages. Kamis have <**alter established at a distance outside the capital**>.]
