Thus, the Revealers of Heroes was born. {break}After Leanon died, the organization had nobody to lead it, and their numbers declined slowly. Nobody really knows how they fare today, but it is very possible that there are some isolated people here and there, working in shadows, continuing the memory of the organization.]

	\n
	You will see when you select a source that a window with 5 gauges appears. These are the characteristics of the source, characteristics that you will affect by foraging. Let's examine them, starting at the top:\n
	@{T5}- @{F90F}Source Extraction Time@{FFFF}: This is the time remaining before the source returns underground.\n
	@{T5}- @{F90F}Source Contents@{FFFF}: This is the total quantity of raw material present in this place.\n

	@{T5}- @{F90F}Extraction Risk@{FFFF}: When you forage a source it becomes increasingly unstable, once the gauge reaches 0, the source releases either a toxic cloud or explodes, but this doesn't mean you have to stop extraction.\n
	@{T5}- @{F90F}Kami Tolerance@{FFFF}: Be careful when foraging, the Kamis get angry if too much is harvested in a certain region. If the gauge reaches 0 you will die.@{T0}\n

	During extraction, a second window appears in which you can see how your work is progressing; the quantity and quality of the raw material you have extracted so far.

mission_tryker_01_popup_desc_mp	[@{W450}Each raw material has three main characteristics: Its @{F90F}type@{FFFF}, its @{F90F}quality@{FFFF} and its @{F90F}origin@{FFFF}. \n
	\n
	A raw material's type determines its potential uses, in other words, which parts of an item which can be made from it. Let's take an example:an oil material, regardless of its origin, can always be used to make either the explosive part of a projectile, or padding for a piece of armor. \n
	\n
	The quality of a raw material will determine the quality of the final item which it will be used to make, and is defined on a double scale: \n
	@{T5}- a @{F90F}quality@{FFFF} scale, the @{F90F}grade@{FFFF}, containing five levels: Basic, Fine, Choice, Excellent and Supreme. \n
	@{T5}- a numbered @{F90F}level@{FFFF} scale, from 1 to 250.\n
	\n
	The lowest possible quality therefore is level 1 Basic, and the highest is level 250 Supreme. Between these two extremes, all combinations are possible. \n

	The origin of a raw material will determine its properties, and of course, the properties of a raw material will have an effect on the final item. Let's take the example of the oil again: Gulatch oil will enable you to increase the damage caused by ammunition, whereas Pilan oil will enable you to craft lighter ammunition. \n
	\n
	Note: Your skill level as a craftsman doesn't limit the type, origin or quality of the raw materials that you can use.

mission_tryker_03_popup_desc_create_action_forage	[@{W500}First of all you should know that an @{F90F}Action@{FFFF}, whatever it may be, is made up of @{F90F}Stanzas@{FFFF}. Getting an Action from a trainer is equivalent to getting all the Stanzas it's made up of. Once you've got a Stanza it's yours for good: You can't lose it and you can use it as much as you like, even for several simultaneous actions.\n
	\n
	With all the Stanzas that you've acquired so far, you're going to be able to start creating your own Actions. Let's look at this together.\n
	\n
	In the @{F90F}Action Bar@{FFFF}, click on an empty space and choose the @{F90F}New Action@{FFFF} option. In the window which has just opened, you will have to choose the type of Action that you want to create, select the @{F90F}Prospecting Plan@{FFFF}.\n
	\n
	We have the basis of our Action, now it's time to add @{FF0F}Options@{FFFF} or Stanzas which give your Action new abilities. Click on @{F90F}Add Option@{FFFF} and select @{F90F}Search for Better Materials@{FFFF}. Make sure that this new Option enables you to look for @{F90F}High Quality Materials@{FFFF}, you can change it by clicking on the icon of a yellow star against a grey background.\n
	\n
	You can, if you wish, add other Options to your Action by following the same process: Using the @{F90F}Add Option@{FFFF} button. Once you have finished setting the limits of your Options, you must balance your Action by adding @{0F0F}Credits@{FFFF}, using the @{F90F}Add Credit@{FFFF} button.\n
	\n
	As you can see, the @{FF0F}Options Stanzas@{FFFF} bring @{FF0F}Option Points@{FFFF} (in @{FF0F}yellow@{FFFF}), and the @{0F0F}Credits Stanzas@{FFFF} bring @{0F0F}Credit Points@{FFFF} (in @{0F0F}green@{FFFF}.) For the Action to work, the total number of @{0F0F}Credit Points@{FFFF} must be equal to or higher than the total number of @{FF0F}Option Points@{FFFF}.\n
	\n
	Credit Stanzas have a negative effect: In this case, the Counterpart Stanza will use up Focus. The higher its level, the more Credit Points it will bring you, and the more Focus it will use.\n
	\n
	Once your Action is balanced, you can confirm it by clicking on @{F90F}Learn the Action@{FFFF}.]

	The @{F90F}Quality@{FFFF} stanza determines the maximum quality of the raw materials that you will be able to harvest.

A very, very long time ago, homins were living quite happily when those big-muscled, tiny-brained Fyros had the bright idea of going and fiddling about in the bowels of Atys. To tell the truth, I don't really know what they were looking for, but I know what they found: The worst plague we've ever known, the Kitin. The Kitin, a pretty bloodthirsty bunch of creatures, didn't really feel like making the homins their friends, so hordes of them surged out of the depths of Atys, through the hole opened up by the Fyros {break}That's when things started to get serious. The homins were relentlessly tracked and slaughtered by the Kitin. The survivors fled to the Prime Roots and hid. Many of them continued to perish. The homins survived as best they could for years until the day they discovered the new lands, far from those they had fled. The first land they emerged onto was this island {break}Since then, a continuous stream of refugees has followed in their footsteps. When the Matis arrived here they were in a hurry to build a new city. Of course, as it's in their nature to want to do more than everyone else and quicker, they tried to install a system that would bring them large quantities of raw materials, without them having to lift a finger. That's when they had the brilliant idea of transforming plants into natural extractors, a brilliant idea which turned against them, and turned their city into ruins {break}A rather tragic story, which to tell the truth, makes me laugh more than cry. The Matis are crazy; they think they're better and more intelligent than everyone else. Most of them still can't admit that their experiment was a mistake. Furthermore, in the past the Matis enslaved my people. So I wouldn't give them the honor of pitying the terrible fate of their city {break}For them it's a tragedy, for me it's a windfall because those ruins are still overflowing with forgotten treasures.

Everything {break}These notions may seem rather abstract to you, but they are essential. As a magician, you will have to learn how to control the sap, to draw your powers from it. The stronger your hold over the sap, the more powerful your spells will be {break}You have within you, like all homins, an innate spell: The Acid Damage spell, which means you're able to fight your enemies by burning their skin.\n

	Before moving onto serious stuff, you have to master this elementary spell. So I'm going to ask you to go and train by killing yubos. These little omnivores aren't aggressive, but that doesn't mean, of course, that they will not defend themselves.

mission_zorai_03_p_msgbox_actions	[@{W500}The stanzas that you have acquired from trainers are yours for good and you can use them as you please to make up new Actions. You can change an existing Action by right-clicking on an icon in the Action Bar, then choosing @{F90F}Edit Action@{FFFF}. You can also create a new Action by clicking on a free space and choosing @{F90F}New Action@{FFFF}.\n
	\n
	Let's take a look at an existing Action to understand how it works. Edit the @{F90F}Acid Damage 1@{FFFF} Action. The window which has just opened contains the stanzas which make up the Action. We can see two kinds of stanza: Options and Credits. The Options determine the nature, power and functionalities of your action. You can add Options to your Action using the @{F90F}Add Option@{FFFF} button. The more Options there are in your Action or the more powerful it is, and the more costly it will be in terms of @{FF0F}Option Points@{FFFF} (Points shown in @{FF0F}yellow@{FFFF}.)\n
	\n
	For your action to work, you have to balance the total number of Option Points with the total number of @{0F0F}Credit Points@{FFFF} (in @{0F0F}green@{FFFF}.) The total number of Credit Points must be equal to or higher than the total number of Option Points. \n
	\n
	So Credit Stanzas are essential to the balance of an Action even if they result in penalties: The @{F90F}Range Credit@{FFFF}, for example, reduces the range of the spell - the higher its level, the more Credit Points it adds to your Action and the shorter your spell's range will be. You can add a new Credit Stanza by clicking on the @{F90F}Add Credit@{FFFF} button. The more stanzas you obtain from trainers, the greater the number of possible combinations you'll have for your Actions. \n
	\n
	It is vital to set the limits of your Actions as your effectiveness depends on it. There is no ideal configuration for an Action, everything depends on your needs and your strategies. Here's an example: You can attribute a powerful Sap Credit to an Acid spell so that no other kind of Credit is required - your spell will have a long range and a very short incantation time but will use up lots of Sap; conversely, you can replace the Sap Credit with a powerful Range Credit, meaning that your spell can only be used at a short range, but can be used as often as you like because it doesn't cost any Sap!]

	I'm glad to see that my teaching is bearing fruit. Let's continue our efforts and move on to the next lesson {break}We've studied Atysian Missile Spells, ie. offensive spells, which enable you to strike your enemy, we have also looked at Affliction Spells, which allow you to handicap your enemy, now let's look at Celestial Missile Spells.]

mission_zorai_07_p_ldc_intro	[We've already tackled affliction spells by looking at the Root spell. Today we're going to look at another: The Fear spell. \n
	Affliction spells enable a magician to handicap his enemy: To blind him, paralyse him, frighten him or even as we've already seen, root them {break}The Fear spell can be a great help when a fight is going badly. \n
	When you cast this spell at an enemy, they are seized by a terrible fear and take flight. But the spell doesn't last long and once it's worn off you can be sure that your adversary will be on the attack again. \n
	While the spell is working, you can take advantage of it either to strike your enemy from a distance or to retreat. \n
	So it's a very useful spell when you are alone {break}By the ruins of Silan you'll find creatures known as yelks who have particularly nourishing flesh and mushroom-shaped growths. Yelks are omnivores and peaceful creatures, but they are very capable at defending themselves. \n
	The real danger with these creatures is the toxic gas that is released when they die. So it's wise to keep at a safe distance when fighting them, especially when they're on the point of dying. \n
	It's in a case such as this that a fear spell can be useful. When you see that the creature is in agony, use your Fear spell and finish it off from a distance {break}This test will give us a chance to fill up our stock of food. Go back to the ruins of Silan and bring me ten yelk mushrooms.]

	I think that I've taught you more than enough to become a magician - you've still a long way to go before you can take on the powers of this world, but I now know that you're ready to spread your wings. You still have a lot to learn about magic, but I'm sure that you'll manage without my help {break}I believe you're ready to go back to the continent. But perhaps, before you do that, you'd like to find out about the arts of fighting, crafting or foraging? If so, I'm sure that my Matis, Tryker and Fyros counterparts will welcome you with open arms {break}Moreover, the Kamis and the Rangers are engaged in a bitter struggle on this island, and your help could be extremely useful to them.

mission_zorai_08_p_ldc_intro	[Celestial Missile Spells are the basis of healing magic. For example, they enable you to treat your allies, give them back their vigor or replenish their sap. Defensive magic is vital if a team is to work well. \n
	The Restore Life spell, that you probably possess and about which I've already talked to you, belongs to this spell category. Of course, it's not the only one. Healing magic is a noble calling for a magician, as they then become responsible for the health and smooth running of their team. It's a heavy responsibility {break}The mission that I am going to give you is particularly dangerous, and it would be suicidal to go alone. Make use of what I've just taught you: Put together a group and make sure it includes a healer magician. If you want to, and if you feel up to it, you could fill this position yourself {break}Moving on to the mission's objectives. Our magicians continue to open up the ruins of Silan, unfortunately they are regularly attacked by predators from the north. These creatures, known as $race_gingos$, are particularly fearsome, and like all similar predators, they attack homins on sight. \n
	So be extremely vigilant or it won't be long before you find yourself under attack from all sides. As you've no doubt realised, your objective is to strike hard and weaken this rabid pack. Eliminate about 10 of those creatures and come back and see me once you've achieved your goal.]

But the truth is that most of us also spend a lot of time planning and organizing convoys {break}\n
	\n
	And if you are seeking adventure, I'm telling you, think convoys! Over the past two years alone, I have visited the Fyros twice, I was there once in the middle of their stunning summer.\n
	\n
	I've also seen the jungle dawns on a visit to one of the most remote Zoraï tribes. I've even been through the first layer of the Prime Roots where I met a Kami who saved me from a Kitin nest. I have many friends among other civilizations, a distribution network and reliable information sources too.\n
	\n
	No matter what, never underestimate the merchants, we often have powerful friends.\n

	Now, if you don't mind, I have to make some money today, I have a convoy to finance, you know. Oh, before you leave, if you are thinking of adventure, let me give you a piece of advice: You should at least progress a little an earn a new title. \n
