They found how to shape the amber and how to store their knowledge inside like an insect trapped in resin. {break}Any homin that wishes to increase his knowledge must seek out the amber cubes. If $givervar$ sends you to me, it must mean that you are one of those who thirst for knowledge. {break}My work allows me to hold and examine many cubes. I share my knowledge with those who pass the tests as laid down by the initiates. This knowledge is precious and we must be careful not to let it fall into the wrong hands. {break}You have shown your desire to explore the paths of knowledge. I congratulate you. {break}As custodian of knowledge of $city$, it is my pleasure and honor to give you this cube, as a reminder of what you have learned today.]

			[A long time ago, following a terrible blaze which ravaged their library, homin sages put their heads together to come up with a new medium to preserve their knowledge; something more reliable than a scroll, all too sensitive to the ravages of time and the voracity of flames. They thus explored the properties of amber: Crafters and magicians combined their talents to fashion amber cubes inside which knowledge could be magically stored. A deal more robust and less cumbersome than parchments or tablets, these cubes also had the advantage of being understandable by all homin peoples thanks to the magic nature of their inscriptions - in those times homins used different dialects. Furthermore, it was found that duplicating a cube was less fastidious than copying a manuscript, so enabling knowledge to be conveyed more easily.\n
			\n
			A great many cubes were created... but the Great Swarming of Kitins and the period of exile in the Prime Roots led to their dispersion. Cubes were lost during the homin flight, and others were hidden to keep them from destruction or unlawful designs. In this way, much knowledge became forgotten. From the outset of the reconstruction of their civilizations, homins have been searching high and low to recover these ancient cubes each one of which may unveil a fragment of that forgotten past.\n
			\n
			The process allowing the creation and the duplication of cubes of amber is still known by homins today, though few they may be. Generally speaking, only old and eminent scholars possess knowledge of this process and it is they who conserve the cubes. They are willing, however, to share the knowledge contained in the cubes with those whom they deem honorable; a homin who is keen to learn by gathering cubes may speak to them. Ancient cubes may be unearthed throughout Atys, however more often than not these cubes have to be reactivated by a homin initiated in the art. The very old cubes are evidently regarded as rare and precious treasure.\n
			\n
			When they are not conserved in an amber chest, over time the cubes lose their energy, only an initiated few may recharge them. A long time ago, a chest was sculpted in amber to preserve all the existing cubes, needless to say its size was legendary. This great chest came to be known as the Chest of Wisdom because of the amount of knowledge it contained. Homins eager to gather cubes have their own chest of wisdom, which is none other than a smaller replica of the first great chest.\n
			\n
			The color of a amber cube often indicates its age, and therefore may also provide an indication as to the value of the information contained inside. Yellow cubes are recent, no more than a few decades old, and are the most common. Red cubes are older and can be centuries old. Purple cubes are the most ancient and consequently the most sought after.\n
			\n
			Most cubes bear the stamp of the civilization that created them. It is therefore possible to come across cubes with seals corresponding to the Matis, Zoraïs, Fyros or the Trykers. Certain cubes, such as those of tribes, often do not bear a seal. As for the Karavan and the Kamis, they have their own mysterious system of recording knowledge, though more often than not they use cubes of amber to convey knowledge to homins.]

			[The forests of Verdant Heights form a magnificent lofty backdrop, a constant reminder of plant life domination on Atys. Here the majestic trees reach colossal proportions, each one of them can shelter hundreds of people. Great rifts are scored into the forest bed caused by the great roots leading deep down into the very bowels of Atys. The forests of Atys are the areas of predilection of the Matis who have built their regal city there. Raw materials are in abundance and include various fine species of leaves.\n
			\n
			Climate\n
			\n
			Verdant Heights benefits from a temperate climate, ideal for homins, as well as plants and other creatures. Seasons alternate from wet and cold to hot and dry.\n
			\n
			Fauna\n
			\n
			There is a wide variety of fauna in the vast forests of Atys. If you keep a look out you will see the shy and swift-running caprynis, a ruminant distinguished by its tough single antler, and the yelk, a great lump of a scavenger easily recognized by the highly prized mushrooms growing on its back.\n
			\n
			Flora\n
			\n
			The forest flora comprises several species of intelligent plants including the lethal psykopla plant, capable of reducing homin and beast alike to slavery.]

			[The Zoraïs have established their enchanting towns and villages in the jungle of the Witherings where the Sap flows in abundance and nourishes the thriving flora. Despite the welcoming and colorful labyrinth of plant life, the perils are manifold. The jungle in many areas is beset by the pestilent Goo - a cancer that nibbles inexorably at life ravaging habitats, plants and bearing forth hideous monsters. However, the experienced explorer will be rewarded by the many beautiful resources that can be found here like precious amber.\n
			\n
			Climate\n
			\n
			The climate is variable, the perfect tranquility may be suddenly broken by the clash of thunder and raging storms.\n
			\n
			Fauna\n
			\n
			The jungle fauna is riddled with weird creatures tainted by the Goo. The traveler will keep on her guard, these creatures roam about in a rabid state and attack anything that crosses their path. The saber horned torbak, Atysian feline par excellence, is just one of these ferocious creatures.\n
			\n
			Flora\n
			\n
			Few places on Atys offer such a diversity of plant life, resources are in abundance and of the finest quality. The fleshy leaved cratcha is a noteworthy specimen. When threatened its single flower spits out a deadly viscous substance which sticks to the victim.]

			[The Burning Desert is a wind ravaged wilderness shunned by all, except the Fyros who have been prosperous in rebuilding their civilization there. Without doubt the most captivating place of all the desert is the great Fyros city which is also a most impressive fortress. Though the dangers are countless and oases rare, the keenest of spirits venturing into these hostile lands will be rewarded by the diversity of fine and precious resources such as the rare types of wood.\n
			\n
			Climate\n
			\n
			Violent and incessant winds, severe drought, stifling temperatures by day and freezing cold at night make the burning desert dunes a baneful trap for the wayward traveler.\n
			\n
			Fauna\n
			\n
			As you journey over the desert you will encounter wildlife found nowhere else on Atys, including such formidable species as the varinx, a predator that hunts in packs, and the goari with its indestructible carapace.\n
			\n
			Flora\n
			\n
			Those who are daring enough to venture over the wind swept dunes will discover a unique array of flora that subsists thanks to the scarce annual rainfall. The oases, on the other hand, form most welcome and flourishing microcosms teeming with luxuriant plant life. An interesting example is the shooki, which, when menaced will thrust forth its head releasing a swarm of mini Kitins.]

			[The magical archipelago of Aeden Aqueous is an enchanting region lost between the jungles and the forests of Atys. The myriad of islands is inhabited by the cheery Tryker people, who have embraced this exotic land as their place of predilection. These lake lands offer an ever changing visage with white beaches, spectacular waterfalls, delightful Tryker floating villages and cliffs whose shapes leave much to the imagination. The area is teaming with resources which include many kinds of shells.\n
			\n
			Climate\n
			\n
			The archipelago benefits from a wonderful climate with sunny weather all year round which only the odd shower or morning mist come to refresh at rare intervals.\n
			\n
			Fauna\n
			\n
			The idyllic landscape harbors an interesting blend of land and marine wildlife. But prudence is the word in and around the refreshing lakes, wild animals such as the three meter long prakker would all too readily snap the life out of the impudent wading voyager.\n
			\n
			Flora\n
			\n
			Plant life here is profuse on land as well as in the crystal clear waters where a wealth of marine plants evolve on the lake bed. The traveler should learn to recognize the stinga plant, which is capable of emitting a painful electric charge.]

			[The Prime Roots make up the most mysterious ecosystem on Atys. Delving into the bowels of the planet, this never-ending labyrinth of verdant caverns will astound the curious eye by its remarkable beauty. The Sap flows here in endless rivers, fluorescent plants softly light up the way while strange creatures prowl about in the glimmering shadows. The Prime Roots are home to a host of mysterious relics from the past as well as a wide range of resources.\n
			\n
			Climate\n
			\n
			The Prime Roots are subject to but a slight variation in climate. Over much of the year the temperature remains cool and the atmosphere damp.\n
			\n
			Fauna\n
			\n
			The Prime Roots are home the most singular fauna on all Atys such as the lethal winged kipesta capable of projecting a potent pollen based substance through its proboscis. Here, the species have had to adapt to an ecosystem deprived of sunlight. The messab has thus evolved to compensate its partial blindness with its infrared facility.\n
			\n
			Flora\n
			\n
			The flora of the Prime Roots has developed the capacity to generate its own light, so creating a truly unique environment. It is worth noting that the jubla, of the family of the psychic plants, thrives here.]

			[Majestic Garden is situated on the continent of Verdant Heights. It takes its name from the beautiful gardens near the ancient capital of Matia. These gardens were elaborated under the reign of King Noblis and constituted one of the wonders of the ancient world. After two years of Prime Root confinement, it was no wonder that Majestic Garden were the first words that came into King Yasson's head on beholding the enchanted forest likened to that of his cherished homelands. \n
			\n
			The new capital was soon established and named after the new born Matis Prince, Yrkanis, as a symbol of renaissance. Added to this came the villages of Davae, Natae and Avalae, named after the first three female babies born in the Matis colony of the Verdant Heights. The region also shelters a single outpost aptly named Psykopla Knoll Trading Post.\n
			\n
			Years of Matis presence has made this forest one of the safest on Atys, safe enough for the novice to begin to cut his or her teeth. That said, Majestic Garden harbors a host of potentially dangerous animals including the ragus, yubo, bodoc, capryni and the gingo. The only species of Kitin present in the region is the kipee, a peaceful herbivore which can be observed munching away at the lush vegetation. Among the flora, the most spectacular is the gathering of psykopla plants clustered on a mound and bound to intrigue the inquisitive eye.\n
			\n
			Another interesting feature is the arena where homins come to match their might and wit, and near which the merchant tribe of the Green Seed (the only tribe in the region) often sets up camp.\n
			\n
			Being one of the first regions of the newfound lands to be cleared, Majestic Garden benefits from a judicious network of bollards that sprout from the ground. These bollards mark the way between town and village allowing the wayward traveler to quickly pick up the lost track.\n
			\n
			Altars of the venerated Karavan will be found inside towns and villages. Kamis have a single altar established outside the capital.]

			[Situated to the south of Majestic Garden on the continent of Verdant Heights, Fleeting Garden was the second region to be explored and secured by the Matis in the newfound lands and has since become a hunting ground for apprentice homins in search of more diverse and more challenging game. The area was originally known as the 'fleeting ground' because anyone traveling through it had to be swift to survive the wild fauna there.\n
			\n
			It was Yrkanis who gave the region its official name of Fleeting Garden with Matis attempts to transform the area into a barrier of beauty and defense of Majestic Garden. However the garden was predestined for a short life. As soon as the Kamis learnt of the transformations underway, the Matis were severely reprimanded and nature soon regained possession of the area. 'Fleeting' in Fleeting Garden thus took on a whole new meaning! The Rising, an area where giants roots grow, is a remnant of these transformations.\n
			\n
			Other places of interest in Fleeting Garden include Trove, a remarkable zone for materials, Den of Fury, where predators prowl, and Kami Circle situated in the east of the region. This remarkable great circle flanked by two mounts of roots is in fact a Kami sanctuary protected by the tribe of the Sacred Sap. These Zoraïs have taken it upon themselves to ensure that the Kamis are not troubled when coming together in the sanctuary.\n
			\n
			The Siblings of the Weed is the other tribe present in the region. The five outposts established in the area are the Rising Border Post; Southeast Trade Post; Finder's Farm; Trove Workshop and Kami Circle Magic Place.\n
			\n
			Fleeting Garden harbors a diversity of animal life including gingos, javing birds, bodocs, wild mektoubs, raspals and frippos. Along with the kipee, the apprentice will watch out for the Kizoar, a harmless flying Kitin if left alone but fast and dangerous when provoked. The psykopla is the region's only species of intelligent plant.\n
			\n
			Altars of the venerated Karavan will be found in the middle of the region. The Kami altar is located at Kami Circle.]

			[The Cities of Intuition was the first region of the Witherings to be secured by the Zoraïs after their two year reclusion in the Prime Roots. It was the sage Fung-Tun who, after receiving a perception as to where to establish communion with spirits of the ancient world, conveyed the right to build the Zoraï city there.\n
			\n
			The capital city Zora was raised in memory of the multitudes who lost their lives during the Kitin invasion of the ancient capital, Zoran. There then followed the construction of the three villages. Min-Cho and Hoï-Cho took their names from two great spiritual leaders whose successive reigns bridged the gulf between the dynasties of the old lands and the new. Min-Cho lost his life during the Great Swarming in the ancient lands, Hoï-Cho became the first Zoraï leader of the newfound lands. Jen-Laï was built in the name of Jena, the Matis goddess. It was the inspiration of Fung-Tun, who, during the Prime Root exile, had taken part in the monthly meetings with the Karavan contingent to take stock of the war with the Kitins. \n
			\n
			Still under the trauma of the great Kitin invasion, the Zoraïs purposely built these first settlements of the Witherings into hollows of the bark to allow better defense in case of Kitin attack. Between the villages of Min-Cho and Hoï-Cho, the traveler may come upon a camp of a crafter tribe, known as the Icon Worshippers, the only one pertaining to the region. The region also shelters a single outpost, Qai-Du.\n
			\n
			This jungle land, being the first to be cleared by the Zoraïs, is a relatively safe zone where novice adventurers may put their skills to a fair test. The only species of Kitin present in the area is the kipee, a relatively peaceful herbivore if left alone. Other wild animals include the javing, ragus, yubo, izam and the mektoub. The traveler will also watch out for the slaveni, the only intelligent plant in the region.\n
			\n
			Altars of the revered Kamis will be found inside towns and villages. A Karavan altar is kept outside the capital.]

			[Imperial Dunes is situated on the continent of the Burning Desert. It was the first region of the newfound lands to be colonized by the Fyros after resurfacing from a two-year stint in the Prime Roots. Imperial scouts were the first Fyros to be sent out to locate a suitable site for the cremation of the embalmed body of Cerakos II, who died two years earlier during the Great Swarming, and whose spirit is now said to watch over the Dunes.\n
			\n
			The capital city of Pyr was established on the site of an oasis surrounded by three acid seams which spit forth fire. These fire holes now constitute the entrance points of Pyr, and it was on one of these points, to the east of the city, that Cerakos was lifted to the upper regions from his funeral pyre. Pyr is, without doubt, the most impressive homin city of the newfound lands with its great halls of learning attracting homins of every race from far and wide, as did the ancient capital of Fyr in its time. The region also shelters a single outpost, Blackburn Trade Post, generally occupied by the Leviers, the only tribe of the region.\n
			\n
			Years of Fyros presence has made this desert land one of the safest on Atys, safe enough for novices to begin to work their way up through the ranks of their office. The only Kitin found in the Imperial Dunes to stir up the Emperor's spirit is the kipee, a relatively inoffensive specimen if left alone and worth preserving for its valued resources. Further to this, the Imperial Dunes harbors a host of potentially dangerous animals including the gingo, goari, capryni and the yubo. The shooki, a spitting plant, is the only native intelligent plant of the region.\n
			\n
			A Kami altar will be found inside the city. A Karavan altar is established outside the southern wall.]

			[The region of Liberty Lake consists of a myriad of lakes and lagoons situated on the continent of Aeden Aqueous. This was the first lake district Trykers came upon after two years of underground confinement in the Prime Roots. The name was given by Tryker sages not only to reflect the general sensation of new liberation, but also as "a constant reminder to all those who would dare harbor thoughts that would infringe on the Tryker fundamental values of freedom for all and all for freedom." Superstitious Trykers believe to this day that the mere evocation of the name in the mouth of a potential aggressor would distance any intention of suppression.\n
			\n
			A first new settlement was naturally outlined in the paradisaical lands and arose to become the new aptly named Tryker capital of Fairhaven. Three villages, whose names are equally reminiscent of Tryker values, also flourish in the region. Crystabell, where crystalline waters flow; Windermeer, known for its windy tops and wind turbines; and Avendale, seated in the beautiful valley east of the capital. Liberty Lake also shelters as many as six outposts including Darkmoor Border Post, Dainty Isle Workshop, Sandy Workshop, Farely Farm, Greenvale Trade Post and Windermeer Farm. They are generally occupied by the Corsairs, the only tribe in the region. \n
			\n
			Being the first area of the Lake Lands to be explored by Trykers, Liberty Lake is consequently the safest of the continent where the young Tryker novice is able to learn the ropes and get to grips with improving skills. But the region is not devoid of danger and the traveler may come across many potentially lethal wild creatures such as the goari, clopper, yubo, yber and the messab. The only Kitin found in the area is the kipee, harmless if unprovoked and providing useful raw materials if hunted. The stinga plant is the region's only native intelligent plant.\n
			\n
			Altars of the venerated Karavan will be found inside the capital of Fairhaven and situated at the entrances of the villages. Kamis have an altar established at a distance outside the capital.]

			[Situated on the continent of Aeden Aqueous to the north of Fairhaven, Dew Drops was the second region of Liberty Lake Isle to be explored and secured by the Trykers from the few dangerous Kitins that began to pullulate there. It was the great sage, Rigan Mac'Darrell, who named the isle after the water crystals that twinkle in the morning light as a reminder of the importance of water. According to folklore these dew drops are tears that fall from the stars to remind hominkind of the fragility of life on Atys. The air is particularly limpid here with a soft breeze picking up just enough to polish the stars in the night sky.\n
			\n
			The region is void of tribes and outposts making it an ideal training ground for the apprentice Tryker to forge his or her arms. Indeed, far away from civilized Fairhaven and its vicinity, the fauna of Dew Drops is more dangerous and includes cloppers, ragus, caprynis, gnoofs, yber birds and izam birds. The stinga is the sole intelligent plant of the region. The only Kitins left after the eradication plan put into place by Rigan Mac'Darrell, with help from Karavan guardians, are the kipee and the flying Kizoar, both harmless if left alone and useful for the quality of their raw materials.\n
			\n
			Two tunnels give access to the isle of the Winds of Muse.\n
			\n
			A Karavan altar will be found in the southwest of the region. The Kamis have not yet invested the area.]

			[The Winds of Muse covers the isle situated to the northwest of Liberty Lake in the northwest of the Aeden Aqueous continent. It owes its name to the tribe of the Silt Sculptors, fine crafters, who have made their home there far away from the hustle and bustle of the capital of Fairhaven. Indeed the windswept isle is a favorite place of meditation for anyone in search of peace and inspiration. The stirring winds also offer a source of energy adroitly harnessed by the windmills that flourish here and there especially along the aptly named Wind Way, which also harbors a workshop.\n
			\n
			Other noteworthy sites are Witchy Coves, where a permanent encampment is established; Muse Watch Lake, offering an expanse of pure water and a farm southwest of the lake; and Big Sleep Mountain, a highly dangerous place where a great predator is known to haunt. The outposts of Musemeer workshop, Three Pillars Farm and Loriagate Border Post are also located on the isle.\n
			\n
			Wild animals present on the isle include the clopper, ragus, capryni, gnoof, the izam bird and the yber bird. The stinga is the only intelligent plant native to the region. The region was cleared of the most dangerous Kitins after the resurfacing from the Prime Roots. Today only the kipee and the flying kizoar are present in the area, both harmless creatures if unprovoked and offering interesting raw materials for the arts and crafts if hunted.\n
			\n
			Tunnels give access to the neighboring isles of Dew Drops, Bounty Beaches and Lagoons of Loria.\n
			\n
			For other forms of transport a Karavan altar is situated in the middle of the isle. A Kami altar will be found in the northwest part of the region.]

			[The melee weapons section describes swords, axes, maces, staves and spears adapted for either one-handed or two-handed use. Other two-handed melee weapons are pikes and magic amplifiers. It will be noted that one-handed weapons allow the carrier to also use a shield or a dagger in the left hand, whereas two handed weapons have the advantage of causing more damage. The 3 types of damages inflicted in melee combat are slashing, piercing and smashing, depending on the weapon.\n
			\n
			The various item parts used for the manufacture of melee weapons include counterweights, grips, shafts, blades/hammers/points. The item part for the magic amplifier is magic focus. The homin expert to see for melee crafting is the melee weaponsmith.\n
			\n
			In the past, each civilization had developed particular skills pertaining to their art of warfare. However, during the two year period of cohabitation in the Prime Roots after the Great Swarming of 2481, crafters and warriors of every race began trading their skills so allowing greater diversity thereafter in the choice of arms. Nonetheless, conservatives still staunchly stand by the traditional weapons and melee skills perfected by their forefathers.\n
			\n
			The Matis were renowned knights in times of old and from an early age developed skills in swordplay, as much as for duels as for slaying the enemy, a gallant knight was also expert in handling the pike both on foot and on mektoub. The Zoraïs, entrenched behind their great wall that ran along their frontiers, kept inter-racial violence at bay with their formidable spears constantly poised along the wall. In close combat, the mace has always held pride of place. The Fyros in battle would terrify the enemy with great roars as they thrust forth wielding their fiery axes. It was during their struggle from Matis slavery that the Trykers developed guerrilla activities and allied their agility with the dagger. They would steal up silently in the dead of night and deftly slit the throats of their brothers' captors. It is to be noted, however, that spears and pikes are often preferred by Federal soldiers for extra reach.]

			[The range weapons section describes autolaunchers, launchers, bowpistols, bowrifles, pistols and rifles, along with the corresponding ammunition. These weapons can inflict slashing, piercing and smashing types of damage depending on the ammunition used. They offer the possibility of attacking one or more adversaries from a distance. Certain weapons, such as the launcher, have the capacity to blast several targets in one shot.\n
			\n
			Various components are used for the manufacture of range weapons and ammunition. They include barrels, triggers, firing pins and shafts for arms; and explosives, ammo bullets and ammo jackets for ammunition. The homin expert to see for range weapon crafting is the range weaponsmith.\n
			\n
			Since the times of the collective exile of homin peoples in the Prime Roots from 2481 to 2483, crafters and warriors of every civilization have been able to access the different weapons and associated skills. Before this period, however, each homin civilization used specific weaponry according to their particular method of warfare. Even today, purists prefer the skills and weapons used in times of old when homin civilizations were at their height.\n
			\n
			In the ancient lands of Matia, according to the courtly code for excellence and exactitude, every noble Matis kept a hand pistol in his or her waistband. Light and precise, the pistol was also easy to use on mektoub back. The Zoraïs preferred the bowrifle, which they posted strategically along the great wall and which allowed guards to reach an enemy at a fair distance. The Fyros strategy was to set their great launchers down to bombard the enemy before sending in the melee troops to finish the job. The Trykers, having developed the art of getting up close to the enemy, developed the bowpistol. Light and accurate, it allowed them a free hand for expressing silent orders behind enemy lines.]

			\n
			The various item parts used for the manufacture of jewelry include jewel settings and jewels. It will be noted that the type of magic resistance obtained will depend on the material used to make the jewelry. The homin specialist to see for melee crafting is the jeweler.\n
			\n
			In the ancient lands, as homins evolved into stable sedentary communities they began to look to distinguish themselves as individuals through self embellishment using exterior signs of wealth. The amulets and lucky charms they would wear to ward off ill fortune and protect them from harmful magic took on a whole new appearance.\n
			\n
			The organic matter used to manufacture such objects were, as is today, of plant and animal origin. They were crafted into ornate jewels the value of which depended on the quality of the animal and the rarity of the raw material used. Packed with blessings and superstition, they became part and parcel of ceremonial rites of passage such as communion, marriage, childbirth... and given as gifts or heirlooms. Each civilization developed its own set of jewelry.\n
			\n
			The Trykers were the first to wear the circle as a symbol of continuity and solidarity, which they would wear as rings on fingers and as toggles in their hair and clothing. The sphere became the fetish shape of the Zoraï, symbolizing individual unity, completeness and integrity. For the Matis, pendants were worn as a sign of rank, reward or special services rendered to the king and Jena. The Fyros wore bracelets and anklets which, in peace conveyed the music of merriment and in war sounded the tumult of terror to the hearts of their enemy.\n
			\n
			Since the opening of trade routes all types of jewels have found their way across the lands and are worn indifferently by all races, though according to tradition, on feast days the proud homin will prefer the jewels of his ancestors only.]

			\n
			Definition\n
			This tribe is made up of former Matis botanists sent to the region to study the intelligent plants. Under the influence of the Kamis and through constant consumption of drugs produced from sap, they took it upon themselves to defy the authorities and protect the plants from cruelty inflicted by Yrkanis scientists. The drugs they consume tend to make them aggressive. They attack all those who enter their territory, and harbor a deep rooted hatred towards their own civilization.\n
			Homins from other peoples have joined the tribe to help protect the plants and keep the Matis at bay.\n
			Note: It is debated whether it really is the use of drugs and the influence of the Kamis that have turned the respected botanists into fanatic plant lovers. Some Yrkanis scientists claim that the cause of the transformation comes in fact from the intelligent plants whose magical faculties are not fully known. However, this hypothesis has yet to be proven.\n
			\n
			Goals\n
			To protect the plants in the region and eliminate homins presenting a menace to them. In the long run, they aim to rid Verdant Heights of the Matis, and then create an immense plant kingdom.\n
			\n
			Relationship to other homin races, the Kamis and the Karavan.\n
			Fyros: The Fyros represent a menace with their playing with fire making them a threat to the fire-fearing plants.\n

			Zoraïs, revolted by Kami incomprehension of their ways, banded together under the aegis of the Black Circle. The tribe has few members but welcomes any Zoraï disappointed with or rejected by their society. They make up a community based on hate and individualism. Whenever they get together, it is inevitably with the intention of hunting down Kamis. For this they use dangerous and destructive magic which greatly perturbs the Kamis. They use magic on any occasion to avoid the slightest physical effort even if it deteriorates their surrounding environment.\n
			\n
			Goals\n
			These Zoraïs have no real goal with the exception of creating havoc amid their own civilization. They are forever trying out new spells on their former friends and companions. Renouncing their former principles, they spread the Goo all about without the slightest concern. They would love to destroy the Zoraï monastery, the very focus of their hatred.\n

			A long time ago, the tribe of the Barkers was formed to conceive the new Fyros city. It is they who dug into the bark of Atys to extract the immense amount of resources necessary for the construction of Pyr. They became such experts in their fields that once the great toil was finished they were judged inapt for combat or any other occupation. The council of grand sages therefore decided to give them another commission in keeping with their expertise before the rumblings of rebellion set in. The Barkers have taken to their new duties despite the bitter feeling at being compelled to live away from the city that their forefathers erected.\n

			\n
			Definition\n
			This tribe is composed of scientists and magicians fascinated by the Goo. Urged by some morbid fascination, they spend their time studying the vile substance and its effects on the flora, fauna and homins. They endeavor to link the Goo to magic in the hope of acquiring more and more power. They have thus discoveries which they jealously keep secret, only giving snippets of knowledge to their disciples and allies, such as the tribe of the Darkening Sap. They are fully conscious that the majority of homins see the Goo as a threat, but the tribe care little of the general opinion and of the consequences of their practices. Nevertheless, they are careful to show a minimum of diplomacy so as not to make too many enemies. But when threatened, they won't think twice about using Goo magic to be rid of their adversaries once and for all.\n
			\n
			Goals\n
			To reap the fruits of their studies of the Goo. They keep a watch on territories all over Atys, spying on the Zoraïs and tribes linked to the Goo. They are especially allied to the tribe of the Darkening Sap, in the region of Verdant Heights, and the tribe of the Antikamis.\n
			The tribe also exerts pressure on governments for Goo study to be accepted so they can lawfully use the Goo all over the planet without restraint.\n
			\n
			Relationship to other homin races, the Kamis and the Karavan.\n
			Fyros: Dangerous as they do not understand the ways of Goo magic.\n
			Tryker: Not very good at magic and make good subjects for experimentation.\n
			Matis: Good magicians, some of whom understand the potential of the Goo.\n
			Zoraï: Dangerous when they fight against the Goo. But some of them, at least, understand that blind destruction of the Goo is not the solution.\n
			Kamis: They present many problems. They are powerful creatures but too stupid to understand our motivations.\n
			Karavan: Agents of the Karavan bring assistance to the tribe when they come up against the Kamis.]

			\n
			Camp: Outlaw Canyon - northwestern part of the region\n
			\n
			Definition\n
			Banned all cities, these outlaws invariably rob wayfarers to survive. They either hideout in small groups in remote areas and set ambushes or they roam the desert on the lookout for easy prey. When they band together they feel strong enough to attack even the Karavan. The Lawless tribe is mainly made up of cut-throats, skinners and deserters. They obey violent and unscrupulous gang leaders who are astute organizers able to rally the ruthless homins together to carry out large-scale operations. They are mostly made up of proud Fyros too violent for their society and preferring to fight for booty rather than against some fanciful dragon.\n
			It is difficult to persuade a gang to return to the straight and narrow because of the disparate origins of its members.\n
			\n
			Goals\n

			\n
			Definition\n
			Some Fyros are suspicious of money and commerce, as well as dubious exchanges that non regulated commercial activity can bring about. The tribe of the Leviers was formed in reaction to the development of 'smuggling' and to guarantee the arrival of quality Fyros products vital for city life. The Leviers believe the best Fyros products should be reserved for the Fyros people, and not be sold to pilfering foreigners.\n
			The authorities of Pyr have a more open attitude towards foreign merchants, and judge the attitude of the Leviers to be a rather excessive.\n
			\n
			Goals\n
			To tax Fyros products sold to foreigners and inspect trade traffic in their region.\n
			\n

			\n

			They hope to convince other Zoraïs to not to resist against the goo but to rather use it to dominate the tribes of Atys. The Masters of the Goo will stop at nothing to subdue the Zoraï cities and impose the power of the goo. They endeavor to federate other tribes who use the goo under their leadership.\n

			The tribe is made up of quarrelsome aristocrats, failed artists, and anarchists, all believing to have been unjustly banished from the cities of Atys. There are a great many magicians in this group of educated homins who prefer to murder by magic than through brute force. Their knowledge of magic had at one time enabled them to avoid falling into open conflict with the Fyros people despite their criminal activities. They would negotiate a certain tolerance with the government of Pyr in exchange for magic knowledge which the Fyros were lacking. But those times have long since past and the Fyros magicians have no longer any cause to be envious of the magic of other peoples. Consequently, the Scorchers are no longer of use to the authorities of Pyr and are now considered as a menace. Considering themselves betrayed, the Scorchers have no qualms about attacking any Fyros crossing their territory.\n

			The Woven Bridles are former wardens of the water of the region. For many decades, they fought unceasingly against the Matis for the control of the region's water points so they could supply Fyros towns. This they did for a price, ensuring their payment by threatening to cut off the water supply when payment was overdue.\n
			Whenever the Matis gained the upper hand, they always managed to reconquer the plateau by attacking supply convoys to starve the Matis garrison.\n
			As time went by, the two peoples learned to live in peace. The fierce warrior wardens, too uncompromising, were soon replaced by more peaceful communities made up of both Fyros and Matis who now run the water points. Considering this as an insult to their honor, the Woven Bridles refused to return to the Burning Desert and will not do so until they are received with the honors they feel are due to them. Scandalmongers say that they prefer to fight against the weak Matis rather than fire, and that most of all they are no longer up to the heat of the desert!\n

			[Wood nodes or knots used in crafting are formed at the point in a stem or rhizome where a branch or twig shoots out. Nodes are obtained either by cutting them out of the rhizome of plants in the soil, or by recovering them from the ground after they have fallen from dead wood on the canopy.\n
			\n
			Once polished, nodes are appreciated for their decorative value. It has been found too that large nodes produce a powerful sound when struck. Indeed, the great bell in the ancient capital Zoran was carved out of a giant syre wood node.\n
			\n
			But by far the most lucrative nodes are the ones obtained from the stems or rhizomes of tansy, patee, yana, nita and scrath plants. Due to their density and hardness, these wood nodes are a prime material for the manufacture of item parts such as hammers and counterweights. These types of wood node are found all over Atys and grant varying characteristics to the end product.\n
			\n
			The tansy node is renowned for being resistant and comparatively light and is used to make light hammers and counterweights.\n
			\n
			The patee node is naturally imbued with sap so giving the end manufactured product a natural sap reserve.\n
			\n
			The yana node is characterized by its extreme hardness and can be crafted into a hammer capable of causing greater damage. The yana node has a homogenous density distribution so making the weapon easier to handle.\n
			\n
			Crafting with nita nodes gives the hammer greater handling ability allowing you to dodge blows more easily; and confers greater precision to the counterweight so making it harder for the adversary to dodge your blows.\n
			\n
			The scrath plant, which is also known for its nutritious berries and prickly galls, produces light nodes. The hammers produced from these nodes can therefore be wielded more swiftly and with greater control so making it harder for the adversary to dodge your blows. The counterweights are also lighter.]

			[Resins are one of the most commonly used materials on Atys. Several plants secrete abundant amounts of these substances. Resin is harvested directly from the trunks and the branches, in the form of sticky filaments that are carefully pulled off of the bark, or collected at the foot of the trees in a its dried form. Hardened fragments that have fallen from the canopy can also bore into the soil.\n
			\n
			Used in a liquid or solid form, resins have several purposes. They are used in construction and in several other trades. Their preservative properties are also valuable. Matis artists also know how to use the colored resins in their creations. The great Lenardi Bravichi himself was a renowned specialist in this area. In a more ironic use, resin dance floors and dice are quite widespread in Tryker taverns. They are less expensive than amber dance floors and are well known for causing a lot of bouncing, in the strictest sense of the word... which never fails to add ambiance to these occasions. \n
			In the warrior craft industry, resins are used for making armor and munitions. The elastic quality and the resistance of these materials make them excellent for producing liners. Lighter resins are used for making munitions ammo jackets. Four resins are well known by artisans for having all of the qualities they need, with slight nuances according to the vegetable essences they contain.\n
			\n
			Glue resins are harvested from many herbaceous species. Aside from their unrivaled adhesive properties, they offer adequate protection and are extremely light. They are preferred by armor makers who want to decrease the weight of their shells. \n
			\n
			Moon resins, which owe their name to the old superstition that says they fell from an evening star, are extremely malleable and allow the creation of particularly well-fitting liners. The armor that is made using these types of liners is more comfortable to wear and improves fighters' dodging capabilities.\n
			\n
			Fung resins are extremely elastic, and the armors that are made out of these resins are more resistant to smashing blows.\n
			\n
			Finally, dung resins are extremely hard: It is more difficult for a piercing weapon to penetrate armor liner made with these resins. Some jokers use expressions like "his head is as hard as dung" when talking about someone who's a little obtuse.]

			[One of the most remarkable materials on Atys is the bark, or barks, because there is such a wide variety. Old bark is harvested from dead trees or from the foot of tall trunks that are renewing their protective covering and losing their old wooden skin. The pieces of bark from the canopy, some of which can reach impressive sizes, are collected from the ground. It is sometimes necessary to dig in order to uncover the older pieces. Some trees naturally create large quantities of bark and regenerate quickly. They are a source of fresh bark, which the experienced prospector will remove with extreme care. \n
			\n
			The largest quantities of bark are used in the production of weapons. Rarer barks are often presented as veritable works of art or at least as decorative objects. Some Zoraï sages use old bark to predict the future. They decode the often tormented shapes of the wood and uncover their hidden meaning.\n
			\n
			Armorers use the barks to make the shafts, bodies or grips of several weapons. In fact, barks are often lighter than wood because they are less dense, while still remaining extremely resistant. They do, however, tend to shatter after repeated blows, which is why they are rarely used in the production of armor. They also have remarkable insulating qualities and form the base material in the production of ammo bullets, whose explosive portions must be well isolated from the outside. The diversity of these barks allow artisans to produce different results depending on the chosen material.\n
			\n
			Perfling barks are the lightest and are used by weapons and munitions manufacturers because of this quality. \n
			\n
			Beckers barks are naturally filled with an acid sap, which not only permits increased quantities of sap in a weapon, but it also inflicts additional damage in the case of an ammo bullet.\n
			\n
			Oath barks are more dense and absorb shocks and vibrations very well. Weapons made with these barks can make more powerful, steady blows, which cause more damage to the adversary. However, ammo bullets made of oath bark do not have this advantage because of their tendency to absorb part of the energy released during the propulsion of the projectile. They are, however, valued for their lightness.\n
			\n
			Munitions made of mitexi bark are harder and more deadly. These barks are easy to manipulate and allow a finish that greatly improves maneuverability and balance in weapons. These weapons are valued by fighters who want a lot of freedom of movement.\n
			\n
			As for adriel barks, they are flexible and light. Blows made with adriel are often difficult to dodge.]

			[This group constitutes food fit for homin consumption other than that of general animal game. These foodstuffs are sought after by all Atysians, be they homins, Kamis or members of the Karavan. Many will offer money and even knowledge in exchange for their nutritive, laxative and calming properties. There are a total of twelve families known to date which include: Green leaves, flower petals, buds, dandelion, mushroom, insect larvae, cereal, eggs, honey, aromatic plants, berries and fruit.\n
			\n
			Green leaf, flower petals and buds of certain plants, once dried, are used as condiments to flavor dishes, for sauces, or to make flavored drinks and sedatives.\n
			\n
			Dandelion is a popular plant used to make a drink for merriment. This brew is especially popular on festival days and celebrations, though is to be consumed with moderation! The Fyros are particularly fond of the beverage and drink joyous quantities during the summer solstice festivities. Indeed, it is said that the Fyros lost the ancient city of Karavia during the summer solstice of 2435 because the soldiers gave themselves to merry-making and dandelion wine! It is worth noting too that for the Trykers the dandelion is also an emblem of freedom. The seeding dandelion is blown to the wind so that seeds of liberty may be sown in the four corners of the world.\n
			\n
			The Matis, in their passion for biological study, were the first to discover that using mushrooms in bread-making made the dough rise. It was the Matis too who first used mushrooms in conjunction with dandelion flowers and berries to produce the wine drink mentioned above. The Zoraïs, for their part, have long since been using mushrooms to induce dreams and attain sublimity.\n
			\n
			High in protein, insect larvae are a much appreciated delicacy for the wealthy. They are traditionally spread on grilled bread slices and served with dandelion wine.\n
			\n
			Cereals, in the form of bread, represent the staple food par excellence of all homins. The texture and taste of the bread varies from one race to another. Matis bread is light and doughy, whereas the Fyros is compact and dense. Zoraï bread is round with a hole in the middle, Tryker bread is sweet and biscuit-y.\n
			\n
			Bird eggs are used in various forms and represent a versatile and filling meal for the more modest homin.\n
			\n
			Honey, either secreted by certain plants in small quantities or produced by bees is used to sweeten dishes and drinks. Honey is also boiled and blended with other substances into hard balls for easy transport to give nourishment to travelers.\n
			\n
			As well as perfuming the air, aromatic plants are used in cookery to flavor dishes, some plants have sedative properties. Additionally, Fyros maids use an oil obtained from these plants which they rub into their skin to protect it from the desert sun.\n
			\n
			The Trykers, as an extension of their love for merry-making, have become expert brewers. By adding fermenting fruit and berries to cereal, they produce an array of beverages including ales and root beers.]

			[The Zoraïs, for many years, lived as nomadic tribes in the jungle lands until they came upon the Kamis who gave them a new meaning to life allowing them to cease their futile wandering and settle down. \n
			\n
			Specialized groups of harvesters learned to reap from the land around the settlements producing a food surplus allowing time to think and to support non-producers like crafters. By and by, with the expanding populations, the need for more resistant materials for construction pushed crafters and harvesters on to discover new and better materials and enhance their properties through careful selection and blending. \n
			\n
			The Zoraïs were the first to discover and perfect the everlasting qualities of amber which became the hallmark of Zoraï culture. After being the first to set down the written word on animal hide, then parchments, the Zoraïs developed a more secure way of storing spheres of knowledge in amber cubes. These cubes were later adopted by other civilizations as the only sure way to conserve precious knowledge, the technique is still used today. \n
			\n
			The Zoraïs also applied their knowledge of magnetism to amber jewels which give the wearer resistance to electricity. \n
			\n
			The greatest achievement in the ancient Zoraï civilization was undoubtedly the great sphere of the temple of Zoran where the High Council was held. It is significant then that during Remembrance Week (see chronology 2483), the Zoraïs traditionally produce a sphere of knowledge of the past year's events which they bind in amber for posterity.]

			[The Trykers adapted to the lake lands like fish to water, quickly forming settlements around the lake shores where resources were abundant. Their innate sense of fellowship pushed them to develop the art of trading, so making them great merchant pioneers before they even thought of becoming skilful fighters. It was the Trykers who established a trade link between the Matis and the Fyros, which was later to become the water route.\n
			\n
			Anything was traded from moon linen to auberwood resin, not to mention different kinds of shell which was highly prized by Fyros and Matis maids. In exchange the Trykers were particularly partial to Fyros desert herb which could be rolled in takoda leaf for smoking, or Matis pigment used for tattooing and paintings in fresco. Incidentally, the walls were rendered in straw and silt taken from the river bed.\n
			\n
			But bartering could be made unfair through intimidation and to avoid discrepancies and guarantee equitable trading, the Trykers introduced a monetary system based on dappers. Dappers were originally made of pearls bound in a precious sap-based substance for extra resistance and which even the Karavan came to prize. The presence of counterfeit dappers that began to flood the market brought the need for the addition of magic during the minting process which could only be implemented under the homin high authorities.\n
			\n
			It may be said then that the Trykers were at the origin of the circulation and exchange of resources throughout the homin lands.]

			[Before the Great Swarming of Kitins in 2481, the Zoraï believed themselves to be protected from all foreign invasion thanks to their great wall which stretched across their frontiers, as well as by the walls surrounding their towns.\n
			\n
			When the first Kitins were reported marching across Tryker lands by guards in their miradors, the order was immediately given to pull up the great syrewood gates. However, the giant insects needed no official invite to enter the jungle lands and literally ploughed through sections of wall before marching on to the temple cities.\n
			\n
			What was built as a sanctuary soon turned into a prison of torture as the Kitins literally barged through the north walls. The city walls that once gave protection now constituted a deathtrap, for the main gates were not wide enough for all the multitude of fleeing Zoraï to escape through before the Kitins were even in sight. Moreover, many Zoraï fell in the stampede and were trampled to death even before the Kitins were on them.\n
			\n
			Zoraï towns have since been built without walls, and Zoraï have learned new combat techniques to defend themselves against Kitin aggression.\n
			\n
			Believing that Ma-Duk created all creatures great and small to form a natural balance within the divine design, the Zoraï have come to accept the Kitins as part of the essence of Atys. Given this 'live and let live' philosophy which promotes coexistence between homins and other life forms native of Atys, Zoraïs will only launch attacks on Kitins if the well being of the community is threatened.\n
			\n
			Kitins in the jungle region take on a mottled aspect allowing them to blend in with the vegetation. Their population is relatively low throughout the regions of the Witherings, the safest region being the Cities of Intuition where only kipees are found to roam. In Maiden Grove, in addition to kipees, the traveler will come across the Kizoar, a winged Kitin. Haven of Purity is host to the kipee, kizoar, kinches and the kipesta.\n
			\n
			The only Kitin nest recorded in the Witherings to date is in Knot of Dementia which was the scene of fierce fighting from 2512 to 2513 when Zoraï and Fyros joined forces to reduce their numbers. Ever since, the nest, which includes every species of Kitin, has been kept in check.\n
			\n
			Kitins found in all other more hostile regions include kipees, kizoars, kinchers and the kipestas, as well as kibans, that collect resources for the colony, patrolling kirostas who protect the colony, and kipuckas, veritable traveling fortresses, that carry resources and larvae from one place to another.]

			[It was Fyros miners who, in their endless search for the dragon, first came across a Kitin nest in the Prime Roots and triggered the destruction of the Empire and the devastation of every one of the homin civilizations. Ever since, they harbor a feeling of moral responsibility which is manifested in the proud Fyros as a thirst for vengeance.\n
			\n
			The Kitin is considered as the ultimate big game and true born Fyros will test their combative skills and courage during the hunt! Indeed, even before the call of war, the previous Fyros emperor, Dexton, was able to build up a reputation as a formidable Kitin killer and so gain credibility to muster and command his first Fyros battalion.\n
			\n
			In keeping with their drive for knowledge, the Fyros have been trying to explain the mystery of the Kitin swarming. It is widely believed that the Kitins were born of the dragon to keep the homin populations in check. The Fyros, then, not only purposely pursue the Kitins for sport and to keep their populations down, but also to find out what they are about.\n
			\n
			Desert Kitins have a red outer shell. As if in defiance of Fyros Kitin control programs, the Kitin population is relatively high in Burning Desert.\n
			\n
			The safest region in Burning Desert is naturally Imperial Dunes where Pyr is situated and which was the first region to be secured. The only Kitin found there is the kipee, harmless if left alone and useful for its carcass once hunted. Oflovak's Oasis is home to the kipee and the kizoar, a flying scavenger Kitin. Frahar Towers and Sawdust Mines host the kipee, kizoar as well as the kincher, a hunter Kitin, and the kipesta, a winged Kitin scout.\n
			\n
			In the most dangerous regions, as well as the aforementioned Kitins and the collecting kiban, the seasoned traveler will also watch out for the kirosta, a formidable soldier Kitin, and the kipucka, a migrant Kitin whose large abdomen allows it to carry resources and larvae to new territory.]

			[In the fateful year of 2481, Tryker guards posted on the water route gave the alert that the treacherous Matis were again gathering to march on Trykoth. As soon as news came of tumult and chaos sweeping through Fyros lands keeping the desert warriors occupied, Matis dukes urged King Domini to reestablish Matis sovereignty in the city of Karavia and secure the lake land resources of Trykoth. But the Trykers would never feel the brunt of the Matis force, as a greater, far more horrific force in the shape of Kitins literally devoured the first Matis contingents at the very gates of Trykoth, before marching through Tryker lands further wreaking horror and desolation.\n
			\n
			Unlike the Matis during their invasion fifty years earlier, the Kitins showed no pity - there was no surrender possible and the only chance was to take flight. Many thousands of Trykers took there chances by heading south, where they might find safety behind the great Zoraï wall. However, in the face of the advancing tide of terror, the Zoraï refused to lower the gates. Thus cornered, Trykers could but stand and fight to the inevitable death.\n
			\n
			After the first wave smashed through the Zoraï wall to the jungle lands, Tryker survivors got organized into small groups - just as during the days of Loria - to allow for ease of movement, discretion and quick attacks on the enemy, in the name of liberty.\n
			\n
			Nowadays, Trykers generally accept the Kitins as part and parcel of Jena's creation, and the Great Swarming as a sign of Jena's wrath over homin violation of Her Law, i.e. excavation of the Prime Roots, veneration of the Kamis, and willingly point the finger at the Fyros and the Zoraï.\n
			\n
			In keeping with their sense of freedom and sharing, and so as not to attract Kitin vengeance, Trykers tolerate the presence of Kitins on their land, though will valiantly fight when their presence becomes a threat to their freedom. This they will do using techniques of combat handed down from the Guild of the Force of Fraternity and perfected by Still Wyler.\n
			\n
			Kitins in the lake lands are characterized by their predominantly blue color. Perhaps it is because Trykers do not seek to systematically eradicate Kitins that their population is fairly low. Furthermore, no presence of Kitin nests on Tryker territory has yet been recorded.\n
			\n
			Liberty Lake, the first region to be secured in Aeden Aqueous, is virtually Kitin free with the exception of the odd roaming kipee, harmless if left alone. Dew Drops and the Winds of Muse, as well as the kipee, hosts the kizoar flying Kitin. The kipee, kizoar, kincher and kipesta are known to be found in Resting Water and Fount. Kitins recorded in other regions include all the aforementioned Kitins, and more species like the kiban harvester, the dangerous kirosta and the mighty kipucka.]

			[The Great Swarming - Memoires of a Matis\n
			\n
			Here I am, at the end of my existence. I am still young, barely 30-years old, but the last few years have drained my vitality. I will die soon, at peace with myself and satisfied with our victory, because the Kitins have finally been pushed back, and the Matis have been saved!\n
			\n
			It all began in 2481. Our powerful monarch gave us the order to seize Trykoth and its resources. We were finally going to teach the Tryker rebels good lesson. At that time, I belonged to the Purple Company, and we were appointed to the rearguard. When we were just a few hours away from Trykoth, we heard a big commotion ahead of us. The hoarse alarms of the war horns and the deafening sound of the drums indicated, without a doubt, that the battle had begun. My heart, and those of my companions filled with excitement. But soon, our royal officers with haggard faces came up from the front and ordered the rearguard to form a battle line immediately. Silence fell again, the drums and horns stopped... What was going on? Did the Trykers manage to crush our army in only a few minutes?\n
			\n
			Before we finished changing formations, we got the answer, and for the first time in my life, I knew fear, real fear. Beyond the line of low hills, a red line that blocked entire horizon suddenly appeared. An impetuous flood, a swarming mass of giant, repugnant creatures poured in our direction. Thousands and thousands of Kitins charged towards us...\n
			\n
			Our captains bellowed orders. Everyone prepared for the shock. The gunmen unloaded a shower of arrows on the monsters. But our projectiles ricocheted off their carapaces! Shot in the claws, mandibles and spines of their carapaces, I saw the bloody remnants of our army. The clacking sound of thousands of mandibles seized all of my courage and my strength. My weapons fell from my hands. Screaming like a lunatic, I ran away. Behind me, the first contact was taking place. Even today, I still hear the cries of agony of my companions and the crushing sound of mandibles as they severed heads, torsos, chests...\n
			\n
			I ran for hours, days. I lost all reason. For days and weeks on end, I roamed as the sole survivor. I escaped, me, a Matis. I abandoned my companions, my flag, my honor, I was nothing. As a yubo, I lived in fear, hidden in the thickets. The clicking noise of the Kitin made me run and hide away, paralyzed by the idea of being cut to pieces. That's how I was discovered by a Karavaneer. He gave me a bag filled with supplies. I ate gluttonously. Once I was satisfied, he handed me a sort of gun. When I came to my senses, I noticed a group of Matis standing behind him - tens and tens of Matis also armed with guns.\n
			\n
			Then, Disforza spoke to me. Before, he was a simple militiaman, now, he was the second in command of a group of fighters, after the Karavaneer. The Kitins had reached our country... The princes, dukes and captains of our most illustrious companies had perished likes animals at the slaughterhouse. The Matis were handed over, defenseless, to the cold, bloodthirsty Kitins. But a large portion of the population was saved, by a true miracle. Since then, the Karavan joined forces at our side. It provided weapons that could pierce carapaces and uniforms that made us invisible to the eyes of these monsters. Almost everywhere on Atys, the Karavan organized little hunting groups, each one led by a Karavaneer scout. It was one of these groups that discovered me. Their role was to find survivors and relentlessly hunt down the Kitins. The hour of vengeance had come.\n
			\n
			For months or years, I don't know anymore, I lived with my war companions constantly. The dark of night, storms, winter, death, despair, nothing could stop us. Kitin after Kitin, we hunted these predators unremittingly. The tactic that was developed by the Karavan was formidable, even if, at times, it was fallible. When a column of Kitin fighters was located, we followed it closely, forming a large circle behind it. Our clothes allowed us to escape the senses of our prey. The instinct of these monsters pushed them to observe the terrain in front of them, and they rarely looked back to the area they had already covered. That way, unless we were clumsy, the Kitins never noticed our presence. For those who were clumsy, their lives were cut short. Several times a day, we attacked the Kitins, bringing up the rear. At each attack, ten or so monsters died. And then we remained still. A few Kitins looked back, searching for an invisible enemy, and then began marching again. That's how, slowly, our hunting groups began to whittle away at the Kitin swarms.\n
			\n
			This guerrilla warfare would not, however, have been enough to conquer the great swarms comprised of thousands of Kitins. The monsters had a weak spot, and the Karavan had discovered it. The Kitin fighters were incapable of feeding themselves alone. The Kitin slaves had to bring them special food and feed it to them. From time to time, a column of Kitin slaves who brought food were signaled on the path of the swarm. So we laid out an ambush for hundreds of slaves that were poorly escorted by just a few fighters. These combats were the most dangerous for us - all the Kitins had to die! Our losses were more significant during these battles. If we succeeded in completely intercepting several resupplying columns, the swarm would end up stopping while forming a big circle. And then, one after the other, the Kitins would perish. How many fields of empty carapaces had we created? I don't even know anymore.\n
			\n
			One morning, we were watching the last Kitin of a swarm die of hunger in a field of carapaces, when a Karavan vessel landed. It wasn't bringing munitions, but it had surprising news. This swarm was the last. All the Kitins were dead. The war was over. But where did we go from there? What should we do?\n
			\n
			The Karavaneers offered to bring us to the survivors in a safe place. Some accepted, some refused. The death of our last enemy left us lifeless. We failed to defend our people, we lived to reclaim our honor. Now, we could join our brothers, where the dead dream peacefully in silence for eternity. May my words survive in remembrance of this time of adversity and heroism.]

			[During the Great Swarming, the Kitin invasions haunted the minds of the Homins, and even the bravest warriors shivered at the presence of these monstrous creatures who swept over the people of Atys. Joint Karavan and Kami forces pushed the Kitins back into the depths of the Prime Roots, but the Powerful could not completely chase the members of the Swarm to the surface. Since then, the Kitins have been moving around the Bark. \n
			The Kitins are present in all the regions of the new colonized territories. They are adapted to different ecosystems, boring into the soil and hunting animals to feed their colonies. It is, therefore, difficult for the Homins to not cross their paths. Some Kitins are not aggressive at first, or only attack when they are bothered. But memories of the Great Swarming are too vivid to allow peaceful cohabitation, and confrontations are frequent, especially since the Kitin invasions are not over...\n
			Attacks have, in fact, been launched many times on the new Homin territories, the Swarms destroying everything in their path to take over that geographic zone. Once their goal is achieved, the Kitin patrols criss-cross the zone to destroy all threats on the newly conquered territory. All members of the Swarm are aggressive during the invasion, the workers becoming as fearsome as the soldiers. The kipees, who are ordinarily peaceful, attack in waves, with groups of kipestas flying by their sides and spreading over the smoldering death. The fierce kirostas pierce shells to inject terrible venom. Large Kipuckas often lead invasions, protected by kinrey soldiers who fight to the death. \n
			In order to fight this scourge, the people deploy scouts who are charged with informing the warriors, who are brave enough to confront them, of the Kitins' movements. Makeshift camps are built to house the garrisons sent by the Homin governments. Political differences tend to be put aside during invasions, and it is not unusual to see enemy clans fighting the monsters of the Swarm side by side. Rewards are offered to the hunters who bring back trophies, and the mobilization of the guilds is encouraged to bring down the great Kitins who are leading the invasions.\n
			The sages have been asking themselves many questions about the Kitin chiefs. Are they just animals, or are their adversaries as intelligent as the Homins? Do they feel hatred, are they simply obeying a survival instinct? The Swarm's objective remains unfathomable.]

			[Kitins Will Fall - told by an old Zoraï lady\n
			\n
			The Kitin war was a time of chaos and devastation, but also a time of solidarity between homins and, more surprisingly, between the disciples of Ma-Duk and Jena. The Karavan, who once jealously scolded us for our love of the Kamis, now stood by us during our terrible trials through the killing fields of war. If only the Kamis and the Karavan could come together as they often did during the fight against the common enemy, what harmony it would bring to the world!\n
			\n
			I was in a group led by my grandmother in that terrible year of the Great Swarming. We were fleeing the Kitin armies when we came face to face with a group of three Kitin scouts who blocked our path. The Karavan Guardians who were conducting us to the rainbow struggled to protect us and we were being pushed back towards the main pack...\n
			\n
			But then there appeared a Kami who cast a spell of distraction to divert the monsters from the Karavan Guardians, allowing them to get a clear shot at the creatures. Together they got the better of the monsters, but the main pack of the legion was already in sight and moving in fast!\n
			\n
			We huddled together off the track in the thick jungle vegetation as the three Guardians provoked the Kitins to avoid us being attacked. They lured them towards the precipice of the cliff a short distance beyond. This was a clever ploy, for the Kamis had projected a mirage that bridged the ravine. As the Kitins were practically on them, at the last instant the Karavan Guardians teleported back to us and we watched the whole Kitin army topple to oblivion over the cliff as do sometimes capryni in the fog.]

			[From the outset it became clear to the Kamis that the Zoraïs were the most apt of the homin species to integrate the world of Atys as they saw it. The Zoraïs were found to resemble the Kamis as much as in their innate proclivity for ecology as in their biological make-up.\n
			\n
			The Zoraïs demonstrated their worthiness in their natural repulsion against barbarous and soul-destroying acts of aggression. It became clear their souls craved a higher sense to their existence, something more than the Karavan orders had to offer.\n
			\n
			One day, while a nomadic tribe was unwinding after a day's travel Cho, the tribe chief, withdrew from the campfire to find some inner peace in the still of the night shadows. The chief felt a movement of the heart as a Kami appeared before him. The power of their mutual attraction was almost palpable in the night air, and a covenant was established between them.\n
			\n
			The Kamis had found their natural servants to help them in their preservation of Atys after being disappointed by Tryker triviality. For the Zoraïs the encounter brought a new meaning to their lives bringing them spiritual and physical stability embodied by the edification of the city of Zoran on the very spot of the encounter.\n
			\n
			This spiritual enlightenment spread to all Zoraï tribes and allowed these nomads to take root and settle in temple cities built to the glory of the Kamis, disciples of the Vital Energy, the Supreme Kami who watched over all and brought wisdom and serenity.\n
			\n
			As a manifestation of their adoration and to differentiate themselves from the lower castes, the Zoraïs took the Kami mask of kinship. The first demonstration of Kami loyalty came one day when they castigated a Karavan expedition for attempting to destroy a Zoraï village as punishment for refusing to carry out a Karavan order. This led to the first Kami - Karavan open conflict.]

			[Early on in their history, the Fyros proved suitable subjects for the world which the Kamis had come to protect. These desert peoples were quite simply fearless in the face of one of the major banes of Atys: Fire. Years of fearless experimentation allowed them to acquire knowledge on how to master the ravenous flames of destruction and even put them to better use. The Kamis sought to win their hearts to rally them to their ecological cause.\n
			\n
			The Fyros for their part, at first cast a wary eye upon the strange creatures. Indeed, their reaction on coming across their first Kami was to hunt it down for its fur! But when the Kamis diverted the hostile projectiles with the wave of a hand then vanished to reappear behind its aggressors without anger, without animosity, the Fyros were intrigued.\n
			\n
			One day their mutual fascination found a pretext for a meeting when the Fyros emperor, Arispotle, during a shooting party was badly thrown from his mektoub near a varinx haunt. The wild animals were nearly upon the semi-conscious emperor when a Kami appeared to face the three varinx before him. The Kami conjured a circle of light around it and Arispotle to ward off the hungry creatures. The varinx at first checked their step, but on the sight of the emperor's gushing wound proceeded to the kill. The two largest of the three, on breaching the magic circle, dropped down dead. The remaining varinx turned tail and bolted away. The Kami then gave the guards, who were soon at their emperor's side, some healing magic to administer to the injured emperor. With this first Kami pact a new friendship and a deep respect was born in Fyros hearts.\n
			\n
			At about this time relations with the Karavan were beginning to turn sour. Jena's disciples, as they called themselves, were against mining and underground exploration and began seriously reprimanding the Fyros by making them pay huge amounts of raw material for their technological magic.\n
			\n
			The Fyros gradually turned to the Kamis for virtually all their magic needs. In return the fire fighters guaranteed protection against the 'dragon fire' and agreed to fight to gain control of it wherever it raged.]

			[The Trykers were the first homin race to catch the Kamis' eye which was at first cast with a benevolent regard. Their mellow manner, their naturally friendly attitude and their love and care of water led the Kamis to consider them as worthy allies in their fight to preserve the environment.\n
			\n
			As for the Trykers, the Kamis were not initially esteemed for their spiritual worth but rather taken as funny creatures with an eerie aptitude for magic.\n
			\n
			Folklore has it that the first Kami contact was made with a homin named Wiksie. The young Tryker was as much tickled as surprised by the Kamis' presence, and completely misunderstood the Kamis' meaning when it pointed to a Goo sodden tree. Instead of understanding the Kamis' warning against the danger of the Goo, the Tryker threw him a fish from his keep net which was attached to the tree. Other encounters of this type confirmed the frivolity of the Trykers at large, and made the Kamis realize they could not be counted on for the serious work of preservation.\n
			\n
			Further to this, the Kamis came to favor the two entities - the Zoraïs and the Fyros - that were prepared to fight against the major scourges of Atys, i.e. the goo and fire.\n
			\n
			It may be said that since those first encounters however the Trykers have endured their fair share of hardships which has given them a more mature outlook on life, straightened their backbone. Today the Kamis would like to win them over to their cause although the Trykers still relate more easily to the authority of the Karavan.]

			[For many years the Kamis had little knowledge of what the Karavan were doing and therefore little means of keeping a check on them. However, through observation and information gathered by their homin followers, over the years the Kamis have come to consider the Karavan as a major threat to the environment they cherish. It would seem that the Technolords have no or little respect for the balance of nature as they incite homins to harvest resources for them without moderation. These resources are then mysteriously extracted from the life cycle of Atys so impoverishing the planet.\n
			\n
			The Kami endeavor to break this cycle of resource drainage by bringing the homins over to their cause. Indeed, the Zoraï giving themselves to Kami worship brought about the first Kami/Karavan conflict in 2210. The conflict enabled the two sides to measure their strength and thereafter kept their distance, coexisting in a kind of cold war.\n
			\n
			In 2481, however, the event of the Great Swarming brought a truce in the cold war. Both Kamis and Technolords fought desperately against the Kitins in order to bring the situation with homins back to normal as quickly as possible i.e. so that the homins could supply resources to the Karavan and so that pro-Kami homins would once again repel the Goo.\n
			\n
			During the Kitin war, the Technolords in the newfound lands kept homins hidden in the Prime Roots under the pretext of Kitin danger above ground.\n
			\n
			This two-year period, which left the Kamis bereft of their faithful followers, gave much cause for anxiety. When the homins resurfaced, understanding that the Karavan gained appeal through their goddess, the Kamis divulged the existence of Ma-Duk as the Kami superior, to counterbalance Jena and offer homins real promise in the attainment of Kamihood.\n
			\n
			Since the end of the Kitin conflict, the cold war between the Kamis and the Karavan has been heating up and the desire to conquer homin faith has never been greater. The Kamis feel more than ever that the Karavan presents a menace that Atys can no longer endure. They are foreigners on Atys and have no place in the design of Ma-Duk.\n

			[The Goo is the Kamis' primary battle. The goo came about with the creation of Atys as the recycling agent which turns dead matter into fertile matter. But due to overproduction, the goo now acts like a cancer turning living cells into morbid ones.\n
			\n
			The goo is easily distinguished by its vaporous aspect and violet color. It is capable of contaminating plants and animals on contact which become deranged, take on an unhealthy violet aspect and become covered with pustules. Goo sources are often guarded by these animals who also act as vectors spreading the goo over the land. If nothing is done to prevent the propagation, Atys will fall into decay.\n
			\n
			The Kamis, having been brought into existence to protect Atysian life forms, are powerless to eradicate the goo which too is of Atysian origin. The Kamis were facing certain termination when they came across homins who were found to be able to repel the goo for them. After providing the homins with magic means to combat the bane, the Kamis realized the meaning of their existence: That their part was to put the pieces of the puzzle of the great design together to create harmony.\n
			\n
			If Atys was to retain its equilibrium and prosper, the homins must be urged to carry out the vital role of repelling the goo and thus become integrated into the design of Ma-Duk. In this way, the natural balance of nature will be maintained, and Atys will continue to thrive.\n
			\n
			For many years, and putting their lives in peril, homin followers of the Kamis have been striving to find a better way of repelling the goo using alchemy, purification ceremonies or fire. But there are those too who would like to learn how to use the goo to turn it against their enemies. Tribes especially, try to corrupt the magic learned from the Kamis to use the goo to increase their own power. In this way, rumors have it that a black magic may be developed and perturb the balance of Atys.\n

			Further to this, the Kamis condemn what they see as the Karavan's passive attitude towards the goo and even as go far as to suggest that they too seek to use it to their own ends.]

			[Relations have never been excellent between the Karavan and the doubting Fyros. This proud people found it difficult to adopt any Law without wanting to know everything about the reasoning behind it. They questioned every commandment and even the existence of Jena. The Karavan consequently had to constantly keep them in line using sanctions which more often than not backfired. Any prohibition only had the effect of arousing Fyros curiosity further. The Karavan responded by lowering the payment of raw materials offered in the name of Jena and limiting access to their technology.\n
			\n
			In spite of what the Karavan portrayed as manifestations of Jena's wrath - the Fire of Coriolis, the loss of Karavia, and ultimately, the Great Swarming - nothing would quash the Fyros thirst for knowledge, especially when they came upon an entity to counter Karavan castigation.\n
			\n
			When the Fyros came into contact with the Kamis under Arispotle, the Karavan, realizing they were in danger of losing all influence over the Fyros, thereon were obliged to make extra efforts to contain their exasperation. The Fyros consequently found themselves in the comfortable position of being able to take advantage of both Kami magic and Karavan technology to further their own quest for knowledge. The Karavan could but tolerate this state of affairs or risk losing them completely as they had done with the Zoraï.\n
			\n
			The Karavan being powerless to save hundreds of thousands of homins from massacre during the Great Swarming, had the effect of further widening the gulf of incredulity. Moreover, in the light of the new relationship with the Zoraï, the Fyros have since taken a clear stance in favor of the Kamis.\n

			[The Eternal Apprentice\n
			\n
			Gregari was an apprentice crafter with as much promise as any of moving up through the ranks to mastery and acquiring respect. Only, though he had an inquisitive mind, Gregari's natural fiber was predisposed to idleness, fatigue would wash over him like a deluge whenever great effort was called of him. Thus incapable of moving on, Gregari remained the eternal apprentice. However, the knowledge he had acquired after umpteen wanderings made him a useful aid for his master's new hands. Indeed many an apprentice spent time in Gregari's genial company before moving on to more serious duties.\n
			\n
			Linia was one of those apprentices. She was at first intrigued by Gregari's blasé temperament more common to little Trykers than noble Matis.\n
			\n
			"Surely you can't go on living the life of a novice, Gregi," said Linia one day as they were gathering some raw materials in the forest for their master. "Honestly, where's your get-up-and-go?"\n
			\n
			"Got up and went, little sister!" drawled Gregari with a wink.\n
			\n
			"You'll never make anything of yourself..."\n
			\n
			"Ain't my fault I can't conclude..."\n
			\n
			"It's because you lack staying power!"\n
			\n
			"Nah, what I lack is a way to get rich quick. Tell you what, you find the recipe and I'll find the ingredients, ha, ha, ha!..." Gregari chortled as just at that moment an enormous clap of thunder ripped open the sky.\n
			\n
			"Sounds like Jena doesn't agree!" guffawed Linia.\n
			\n
			"Cor blimey, she don't!" seconded Gregari as the rain came pelting down and they made for a hollow in the side of a hill with their frightened mektoub packer. There was another crack of thunder and Linia reached out just in time to try to steady the frightened mektoub while Gregari leaned against a mound contemplating the sky...\n
			\n
			"Give us a hand, Gregi!!" she called.\n
			\n
			"Don't panic, little sister," returned Gregari coming back to himself and coolly grabbed the reins and tied the mektoub to a tree leaving it bucking wildly... "There, he'll get over it once he's spent!"\n
			\n
			There came another crashing whiplash and the mektoub spent the last of its feral force with a mighty back kick square on the side of the hollow. Where the animal had kicked a plaque of clay cracked and crumbled away leaving a hole the size of a homin's head! Gregari poked his into the blackness, and as his eyes became gradually used to the darkness his sight swept over a thousand flower heads shedding their light from the bed of a vast cavern. Enchanted by the discovery, he proceeded in prying open the hole further making it big enough to slip through.\n
			\n
			"Look, Linia, this must have been an entrance sealed up long ago, see?! There are stairs leading down into the cavern," he exclaimed to the younger apprentice in a new hushed and excited voice.\n
			\n
			"But, Gregari, you know what this is?!"\n
			\n
			"A way to get rich quick, baby!" returned Gregari with kindled ardor. "Look at those materials, there for the taking!"\n
			\n
			"But it's forbidden to enter the Prime Roots!"\n
			\n
			"Only if you get caught! Come on, today's our lucky day!"\n
			\n
			"Looks spooky to me..."\n
			\n
			"Well if you ain't coming, stay here and keep a look out."\n
			\n
			"Be quick!"\n
			\n
			Without further ado Gregari climbed down the dark stairway to embrace the wonderful display of rare materials in the Prime Root cavern.\n
			\n
			\n
			A week later back in Davae, Gregari was clad head to foot in the finest clothes an apprentice was ever seen to wear. On being questioned by his master as to his turnaround of fortune, Gregari said he'd come into some inheritance, with which he was determined to make something of himself.\n
			\n
			Some time after, this time in Natae, Gregari and Linia were sharing a fabulous meal of mektoub trunk soup, torbak steak with tender baked cactus flesh, when there was a knock at the door. Gregari's new maid showed in a certain Zinovitch Kidditch, a noble Matis Master crafter.\n
			\n
			"Sire," he said "I am known to your master who tells me you have left his company to break out alone. He tells me too that you desire a solid occupation. Sir, I stand before you with all I own, the clothes I wear and my title of Master of the Crafts. Fortune has turned against me, I must recover one hundred thousand dappers for which I would sell my title along with the accompanying secret stanzas of my profession..."\n
			\n
			Zinovitch set a delay of a week after which he would take his offer to the capital of Yrkanis where he was sure to find a taker.\n
			\n
			"I've only thirty thousand dappers left," said Gregari to Linia once Zinovitch had been shown out the door.\n
			\n
			"And I five thousand..." returned Linia.\n
			\n
			"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"\n
			\n
			"I'm thinking it unwise, what if we bump into the Karavan on the way back?"\n
			\n
			"Rubbish, I know a way back where the Karavan never go!"\n
			\n
			"Besides, that hole gives me the creeps, all those little lights like beady eyes watching!..."\n
			\n
			"All you have to do is haul the stuff up to the surface on a rope and stash it in the saddle packs, you can hardly call that breaking the law, can you? We'll share out the booty so we can both buy our fair share of the crafter's stanzas, right?! Just imagine folk's faces when we roll into Davae and put in a bid for the our master's premises!..."\n
			\n
			So it was agreed. The two apprentices took a pair of mektoubs, rode out undercover of the night and by first morning light were at their hollow where the gaping hole was camouflaged as they'd left it but a month earlier.\n
			\n
			"Come look, Linia, have you ever seen such beauty?" said Gregari gazing from the top of the stair across the expanse of the twinkling cavern.\n
			\n
			"Jena forgive us our trespasses!...\n
			\n
			"Poah!..." exclaimed Gregari with a nonchalant wave of the hand and skipped down the stairs. He then set to work bailing out sackfuls of fabulous material which he attached to the end of some rope for Linia to heave up to the surface. He swept away another bunch of precious flowers and looking back at the uncovered patch he could hardly believe his eyes...\n
			\n
			"Amber! I've found amber!! And texts inside!" he cried out ecstatically as he climbed up the stairs cut into the dead tendril to the gaping entrance. "Linia, d'you hear me, little sister?! I've found amber!!" But their was no reply.\n
			\n
			"Linia?!" Still there was no reply.\n
			\n
			As he approached the opening at the top of the stairs, Gregari caught sight of some master crafter boots and a voice he knew then drummed on his ears and pounded in his heart.\n
			\n
			"Your number's up, Gregari!..."\n
			\n
			"The Kuilde!" uttered Gregari to himself as the true identity of the ruined Master Zinovitch Kidditch dawned on him. Then he saw two pairs of black boots that flanked those of Linia.\n
			\n
			"What you see is nothing but trickery, come out before the wonders blind you for good! The Karavan can cure you..."\n
			\n
			"Gregi, come out, it's dangerous, the Karavan said they won't hurt us, they have come to save us from the doom," cried Linia. Alas, the next thing she heard were footsteps echoing away deep into the cave followed by an appalling scream of horror and a monstrous roar, then the dead silence fell. Gregari was never seen again.\n
			\n
			"He was blinded by the illusion of the wonders, Linia," explained Zinovitch. "It is the way of the Prime Roots to entice weaker victims into the depths where death lies waiting, it is the punishment for breaking the Law. You are lucky, you have not been corrupted too deeply, you will receive the treatment to rid the illusion from your mind."\n
			\n
			Linia followed the treatment and thereafter in her gratitude to the Karavan for saving her, became a full member of the Kuilde and a fervent servant of the disciples of Jena.]

			[Until the Great Swarming, the vast majority of Zoraï had never ventured beyond their great wall which marked the frontier of their lands. Exchanges between Matis and Zoraï were, then, few and far between, and the few Zoraï that did venture to Matia were generally given a mixed reception. Though the Matis welcomed jungle raw materials and Zoraï techniques of storing knowledge, they remained dubious as to their strange appearance and their mysterious talk of Kami worship, to the point of questioning their moral fiber.\n
			\n
			However, two years living together in the Prime Roots (2481-2483) allowed both peoples to at least better understand their religious outlooks and see that they shared the common needs of all hominity and that they both loved their children!\n
			\n
			The Matis also discerned in the Zoraï a certain sense of high-mindedness and sophistication which for a time brought the two peoples closer in spite of their religious differences. What is more, like the Matis, the Zoraï possessed in-depth knowledge of nature which they could not exploit to the full, due to their worship of the Kamis. For this the Matis generally agree that the Zoraï religion is detrimental to individual achievement.\n
			\n
			In the newfound lands the Zoraï have time again shown their friendliness towards the Matis peoples and have been called in to arbitrate in negotiations between Matis and other homin races on a number of occasions. Indeed, if Yrkanis ever came to power, having dethroned the tyranic monarch, it is thanks to the Zoraï leader's indulgence in giving him asylum in Zora.\n
			\n
			Many Matis feel discomfort, even resentment for this debt which some claim tarnishes their honor and credibility in the eyes of the Karavan. Indeed, in the light of the increasing friction between the Karavan and the Kamis, it is increasingly felt that friendship with the pagan Zoraï is 'incompatible' if not unfaithful.\n
			\n
			Despite the growing antagonism, in exchange for Matis positions in the Witherings, a number of pro-Zoraï tribes have been authorized to settle in Verdant Heights. These tribes include: The Siblings of the Weeds, Sacred Sap, Oasis Diggers and Ecowarriors. Anti-Zoraï tribes positioned on Matis lands include the Woven Bridles and the Darkening Sap.\n

			[With the debacle of the great Matis cities of Matia in the face of the Kitin onslaught of 2481, the Matis had but one means of survival left open to them: Flight. The Karavan pointed the way to the forests of the east where great teleportation rainbows led to the vast sanctuary of the Prime Roots which the Kitins had not yet infiltrated. For the time of a moon, Matis in their thousands were able to breach the laws of distance to escape the jaws of death. With each new day the underground galleries and caverns were explored, secured and pushed further to house and provide for the ever increasing population. At one point there was some debate as to how many more refugees the Prime Roots could accommodate. But then the influx began to abate suddenly, for one after the other the rainbows were destroyed and soon the Prime Root populations ceased to swell.\n
			\n
			The Matis court was reconstituted and partook in debates for the improvement of living conditions. Underground territories were designated for each race. The first interracial round table was devoted to how to combine forces to make a viable haven of the Prime Roots. King Yasson, signed the Edict of Four Peoples to establish an entente cordiale with the Zoraï, Tryker and Fyros chiefs and a code of conduct was drawn up to ensure the peace was kept. The edict also appointed King Yasson as homin delegate to the Karavan.\n
			\n
			The wise King, understanding that this was a time to anticipate what the future held, cleverly promoted the botanical talents of the Matis by having the crafters play a leading role in the furnishing of the Prime Roots. To add to this, the stay in the Prime Roots allowed the Matis to further their understanding of plant life and develop new techniques. It may be said that increase in demand for Matis wares stems from these Prime Root years. The illustrious Master Crafter, Lenardi Bravichi, was the great orchestrator of the campaign of Prime Root embellishment making the two-year confinement more tolerable.\n
			\n
			Life was organised around three main time periods: Breakfast and work till 'midsun'; lunch and work till eventide; dinner and evening worship before bed. The main bulk of Matis work consisted in elaborating furnishings and clothes for the homin residents at large. Children were given tuition in halls of learning. In accordance with the edict, their afternoons were given to physical exercise and recreation with children of other races. With one day in five given to rest, there were many occasions for feasting such as the birth of the King's son and heir, Yrkanis, which rekindled sunken spirits and the belief in the future.\n
			\n
			Shortly after his arrival, King Yasson was summoned to the entrance of the upper galleries to the surface where he met with a Karavan contingent. The order was to remain under cover until the all clear could be given, the Karavan having sent in a major force to rid Atys of the Kitins.\n
			\n
			The Karavan also strongly warded against homins mixing throughout their underground confinement. Jena's disciples feared that the homin survivors would fall into dispute and kill each other outright in the Prime Roots where the Karavan were unable to intervene. Yasson reassured the Karavan that all was under control, though not once did he transmit the Karavan order, knowing it was impractical and could only upset the balance of the temporary underground society. What counted was getting through the ordeal and being reborn from the ashes of the past thereafter.\n
			\n
			For over two years, at each full cycle of the moon, Yasson surfaced with a group of sages (one from each race) to receive a Karavan report. On the twenty-fifth meeting, the Karavan announced the Kitin retreat, on the twenty-sixth the all clear was given and at last homins could resurface. King Yasson sent out a reconnaissance party in search of new territory while homins were able to make merry and take in the air on the surface. It was during one of these resurfacings that a minor incident occurred that revived repressed tensions of old. Thereon, while waiting for news of the reconnaissance teams, the homin council of chiefs took the decision to segregate races to avoid further incident.]

			[The Edict of Four Peoples was signed in 2481 in the Prime Roots to establish a code of conduct to enable the four homin peoples to live in tolerance and harmony during their underground exile. It constituted a historical turning point in homin relations and thereafter allowed homins to plan a new start on the new territories amid a climate of mutual support.\n
			\n
			The Edict was structured essentially around three axes: Spiritual, which granted freedom of conscience and the right to practice the religion of one's choice or to abstain from religious practices; territorial, to provide freedom of movement and the right to pass in and out of territories in case of Kitin attack; commercial, to allow equitable access to the buying and selling of merchandise and raw materials.\n
			\n
			The Edict of Four Peoples was in effect for the seventeen years that spanned the first period of homin reconstruction until it was revoked by the Matis king Yasson in 2498.\n
			\n
			In 2497, the Tryker government decided not to renew the lease of Lagoons of Loria to the Matis. Lagoons of Loria, until then, had provided the Matis with water supplies and resources for their reconstruction. The Trykers went further by striking a pact of alliance granting the Fyros exclusive commerce and preferential prices for large amounts of Lagoons of Loria resources. In short, the Matis were deprived of resources for reconstruction both as tenants and as customers! The Trykers were thus guilty of violating at least two articles of the Edict of Four Peoples.\n
			\n
			After a period of remonstration, the Matis king revoked the Edict and took actions to limit movement of Tryker and Fyros merchants traveling through Verdant Heights. Tithes were imposed on Goods not destined for Matis consumption.\n
			\n
			Many non-Matis merchants, in response to the turnpikes in Verdant Heights, preferred to brave the Prime Root passage rather than pay to pass through the onerous turnpikes. Others still chose to avoid attracting the wrath of the Karavan and take the long way round to Burning Desert through the Witherings.\n
			\n
			Seeing the valuable resources being slowly drained to Burning Desert, King Yasson had no other choice than to drive the Tryker contingents out of Verdant Heights and annex Lagoons of Loria. The result was the Autumn War (2499-2500) during which Fyros sided with the Trykers against the Matis.]

			[The Locket of Julea - told by an old Matis Preacher\n
			\n
			Would you believe that the first Matis ever to set eyes on a Kitin lived to tell the tale? \n
			\n
			His name was Angeli di Fabrini, of noble stock, second son of a high ranking officer who, having but a small fortune, placed him with the clergy. At sixteen, after the festivities of the three kings that announce the coming of colder days, the young seminarian was sent to the northern front on his first mission to reinstate the word of Jena in the hearts of Fyros villagers residing in the outer limits of the desert who had been victim to the advancement of heresy. Indeed, the song of pagan chants was in danger of resounding in our lands. After the long and grueling ride to the Matis outpost and a well earned rest, the seminarian was eager to make his first tracks in the desert.\n
			\n
			Angeli rode over the hot desert dunes clad in the attire of his station, to which, despite the general agnostic feeling, no Fyros would manifest untoward feeling. At the first Fyros village, known as Colomo, the young Matis was listened to by the mayor with polite indifference and entertained by the local mage who offered him a bed till an imminent storm passed over. But the mage, not for a second imaging that the young Matis apprentice seminarian could feel any affection other than brotherly love, introduced him to his daughter, Julea.\n
			\n
			A strange sensation stabbed Angeli di Fabrini full in the heart as he followed the daughter's argument against the existence of the dragon and even of Jena. Spellbound by Julea's beauty and assurance, Angeli could only stammer his learning and more often than not found himself acquiescing to legitimatize her questions. As for the young Fyros girl, she was at first intrigued then charmed by the boy's refined manner and before long love's spell kindled in both their hearts. \n
			\n
			It was on the forth evening, sitting out on the silent dunes, that their bare arms first, then their lips touched as natural as the wind caresses the dune...\n
			\n
			But the following morning gave no time for embarrassing glances or fumbling words or even a simple gaze of reassurance, for news came of a terrible invasion of monsters and the village chief ordered the immediate evacuation of the village. Not knowing then what was awaiting them, the fighting men sadly rode on to join the imperial army at the capital of Fyre leaving the children and homins unfit for combat to travel further north lest local tribes launched an assault in the absence of warrior protection.\n
			\n
			Angeli was left to rejoin his own people, though he stayed long enough to exchange lockets with Julea, each locket enclosing a lock of hair. And so after a last embrace they parted forever, but the novice's adventures were not over by a long chalk.\n
			\n
			On his way back to the forest lands he was caught in a desert storm and stopped to shelter behind his mektoub packer by an oasis when, hardly fifty yards behind him, he beheld an awful dark mass that stretched tree hundred yards wide and trailed a long way into the distance. The seminarian had set his eyes upon an army of Kitin soldiers advancing at a furious speed. It was futile to run, he sat with his prayer book savoring his lost love, recalling the precious moments as the whole Kitin army marched straight past him not thirty yards from where he was praying. But then, a number of the creatures came to water at the oasis...\n
			\n
			The mektoub was well broken in and under the seminary's firm hold did not jolt. Angeli sat still and studied the Kitins watering barely fifteen feet from his tree. As soon as the dreadful legions had passed he was able to continue southeast on to his outpost to give the alert. The only 'rational' explanation as to why the Kitins had left him unattended was that they were quite simply not yet used to the Matis smell! But what became of the young seminarian?\n
			\n
			No, he never married, his heart remained faithful to Jena thereon. And, thanks to Jena, you are looking at him now, dear young homin. Yes, though between you and me, I still wear the locket of Julea close to my heart.]

			[The Company of Lenardi Bravichi\n
			\n
			When the great Matis artisan, Lenardi Bravichi, came to the Prime Roots that had become home to the homin peoples following the terrible swarming, he could hardly contain his emotion. On seeing the weird and wonderful flora, he set out on perhaps his greatest work to make living there so much more soulful.\n
			\n
			In a frenzy of creation he set about working on patterns and prototypes that would serve as furniture for the time the homins would reside there. Once a pattern was worked out he would impart the process of creation to another master crafter who would then dispense the knowledge to other crafters so enabling the rapid production of furniture to comfortably furnish the caverns before the winter set in.\n
			\n
			One of his greatest creations was his colored lamps made of living luminous flowers which served to light up the high and otherwise gloomy corridors. To help him in his great work, Bravichi formed a company of homins (later known as the Company of Lenardi), all masters in their field from every race, to help him in his beautification of the Prime Roots.\n
			\n
			A team of Fyros miners led by Gaylus Cetheus specialized in digging out the trenches and chambers in such a way that only once was there an accident of subsidence, despite the many miles of excavated galleries and caverns. A Tryker by the name of Dally Baily devised ingenious engines to enhance air flow. A Zoraï with extraordinary magnetic powers, whose name escapes me now, implemented an intrusion alarm system as well as a communication system consisting of a series of magnetic rods and wooden tubes allowing homins to communicate from one chamber to the next without having to displace themselves.\n
			\n
			One day, Lenardi Bravichi set the Fyros miners to work on an interesting chamber which stepped down into a perfectly symmetrical corridor. The Fyros maintained that the site could only have been created by the hands of homins long ago for this was no work of nature! Then Gaylus began the excavation until his pick axe hit upon a strange sounding object tougher than anything known to the homin eye. However, Lenardi, true to his temperament, was set on his work schedule and finding no use for the object did not desire to lose time on his works. But the Fyros insisted and dug a trench around the strange object uncovering a concave oblong ten foot wide. The minors were overcome with excitement. The company gathered together, and the Zoraïs that were present recommended caution. They felt there was a dark menace linked to this discovery... the following events proved them right.\n
			\n
			Firstly, a Tryker stamping the ground to see where to place the airing machine put his foot through a transparent panel and nearly fell into the hollow beneath. The strange material had cutting properties harder than thorn and sharper than nita wood that ripped through the Tryker's skin and later caused gangrene to set in. He had to have his leg cut off! There was worse to come... \n
			\n
			The Fyros, despite Zoraï foreboding, went ahead with his plan to fully uncover the object and in his enthusiasm undercut the wall of an upper chamber which caved in on top of him. With this second unfortunate accident and no more backing, the area was closed and a tombstone planted in memory of Gaylus Cetheus, so bitterly stung for his enflamed curiosity which some say tipped the balance of his reason.]

			[The period known as the New Beginning (2483 to present day) marks a major turning point in the spiritual development of the Zoraï people.\n
			\n
			The Kamis, bereft of their homin followers during the Kitin war (2481-2483) had been deeply distressed at the knowledge that for two years the Karavan entertained relations, be they limited, with the homins and were able to try to impose their teachings.\n
			\n
			However, their foreboding was dispelled when the Great Sage, Hoï-Cho, rejected Karavan advances and reestablished Kami communion immediately after resurfacing from the Prime Root Sanctuary into the new jungle lands. As a manifestation of their gratitude and as a reward for the merit of fidelity, the Kamis promised to lead the Zoraï further on the pathway to the eternal bliss of the Kami Supreme.\n
			\n
			It should be remembered that up until that time the Kami Supreme had remained a religious dilemma and for want of a name, the Zoraï had used the name of Jena, the goddess in the Karavan prophecy. Even though many a Zoraï felt in their fiber that this did not ring true, the Kamis had neither refuted nor endorsed this.\n
			\n
			So it came about that at the term of the first Remembrance Week (see Zoraï chronology), Hoï-Cho was teleported away by a Kami master to meet the Great Kami.\n
			\n
			According to the Hoï-Cho scriptures, on seeing the great one, the Zoraï great sage fell to his knees in an act of prostration as did the first Cho before the first Kami. The word Ma-Duk, meaning the Great Genitor, instinctively came into his mouth then sank into his heart filling the hollow there. The encounter marked the death of Jena for the Kami followers and the beginning of a new era where Ma-Duk promised attainment to kamihood for homins achieving full merit.\n
			\n
			Many encounters followed which, in 2495, Hoï-Cho dictated for posterity in the Book of Revelations. Revelations opens with the first articles, expressed by Ma-Duk, by which a homin may reach kamihood. These articles have since become the Zoraï code of religious conduct and are as follows:\n
			\n
			Article 1) I am Ma-Duk, the Genitor, the Life Giver whom created Atys, I am at one with the Kamis who are part of me, thus you must adore them as you will the Genitor.\n
			Article 2) Follow the pathway of Kami enlightenment, it will lead you to elevation into the sphere of Kamihood.\n
			Article 3) To enter the sphere of Kamihood and be at one with the Genitor, you must follow the path to enlightenment to attain merit.\n
			Article 4) Attain merit by worship and by caring for Atys, she is wrenched of my bosom.\n
			Article 5) Provided you are on the pathway of Kami enlightenment, I will rekindle your spirit if you die before having reached full merit.\n
			Article 6) Be tempted not by false gods, they cannot be of Atysian composition, they have no place in my design, they create imbalance.\n
			Article 7) Be the enemy of excess and your journey on the path to kamihood shall be plentiful.\n
			Article 8) In the same way as I have sown the seeds of existence to the wind to prepare for your life on Atys, so you must spread Kami enlightenment to the four corners of the world.]

			[The Zoraï, a spiritual people, have built their society around the worship of the Kamis who they see as the living embodiment of the pure energy that created Atys. As a confirmation of their devotion to the Kamis, from puberty the Zoraï bear the Kami mask of kinship so making the divinities an integral part of Zoraï existence.\n
			\n
			Up until recent history the pure energy was given the name of Jena, the goddess of the Karavan prophecy. But during the first Kami-Karavan conflict, it became very clear that these were no brothers in divinity and that they could not share the same creator. What is more, not once did a Kami let drop the name of Jena, only speaking of the Creator as the Kami Superior. Thus, in the uncertainty, it was decided to build temples in the name of the Kamis until the nameo of the Kami Superior became known.\n
			\n
			The confusion continued until the resurfacing from the Prime Roots after the Kitin war when Hoï-Cho, the Great Zoraï Sage, was at last taken by the Kamis to encounter the Kami Superior, that he instinctively named Ma-Duk. The Zoraï have since been given to believe that the Karavan are nothing but aliens and that their goddess is nothing but a deity born of their imaginations to reduce hominity to slavery. This, they believe, is exemplified by the fact that the Kamis seek to preserve the habitat of all creatures of Atys made by the creator, whereas the Karavan do not.\n
			\n
			Nowadays, thanks to the writings of Hoï-Cho, the path to the attainment of kamihood is made clearer and better understood by all. The divine order is as follows: Ma-Duk, the great Kami, invests the Kami-Kos with life energy who in turn watch over the Kamis. The Kamis stand vigil over the plant kingdom and ensure that no one may destabilize the fragile equilibrium of the planet. The Kamis are therefore to be venerated and protected as they constitute the first step in kamihood. Indeed, the merest act of life depends on such and such a Kamis.\n
			\n
			The Zoraï believe in the existence of other carnal spheres which each homin may inhabit after leaving this world. The homin who gains enough merit will be born into the future world as a Kami until being able to enter the all knowing bliss as a Kami-Ko. This is the promise of Kami enlightenment to which all homins may accede if they follow the Path.\n
			\n
			As well as by preserving Ma-Duk's creation, a major part of gaining merit is through passing on the good word so that others may have the possibility of attaining enlightenment. For this reason, the Zoraï sages aim to convert the world to Ma-Dukism and free hominkind from the influence of the Karavan.\n
			\n
			Cho was the first ever Zoraï to encounter a Kami. Cho became the first Zoraï spiritual leader who united the Zoraï people around Kami enlightenment. The ancient temple city of Zoran was erected on the spot of that first encounter. Today the official site of the cult is Zora.]

			[Tears of Serenity - A Kami story told by a Zoraï\n
			\n
			Many years ago, when hominkind had barely ventured forth from the darkness of pre-existence, a nomadic tribe was camped in the heart of the ancient forest lands. The Zoraï chieftain, whose name was Cho, was set back from the campfire under a tree in contemplation of the night sky when a strange presence enlivened the fiber in his body, warmed the liquid within his temples. He closed his eyes. He experienced an inner completion which soothed the wounds within as his eyes welled exuding the first Tears of Serenity.\n
			\n
			He slowly opened his eyes and through the blurred vision he saw the source of his inner peace and harmony established upon a tree. The visitation blinked back at him, vanished and then reappeared in front of him. Cho bowed in an act of prostration and the entity spoke: "Kami, hungry," and placed its hand on its chest. Instinctively realizing that the Kami was hungry of heart, Cho rose to his knees and moved his hand to his heart likewise: "Yes, Cho desires more friendship, divine Kami, how can I earn your love?"\n
			\n
			The Kami pointed to the tree upon which it had first appeared and Cho immediately understood that the infection of goo there gave rise to the Kami's concern. "I shall settle here, Kami, my people shall serve you and cleanse the land of the devouring sickness as you have cleansed my spirit."\n
			\n
			Cho spread the word to his brethren throughout the lands to bring them together around the Kami experience so they too might feel the peace and ease their anguish within. The first magnificent temple to the glory of Ma-Duk and the Kami Guardians was built on the very spot of Cho's enlightenment and grew into Zoran, the ancient capital of the Zoraï. And let us remember Cho's words: "It is within the grasp of every homin to feel the Tears of Serenity."]

			[Since the resurfacing from the Prime Roots in 2483, the Day of the Pyre has been celebrated in the Fyros capital every year to commemorate the sacrifice of the Emperor Cerakos II and the passing from the old life to the new in the Burining Desert. For symbolic reasons, this event takes place on the night of the winter solstice, which is simultaneously a period of grieving and a celebration of the return of the light that will gradually warm the earth, escorting it into springtime.\n
			\n
			Traditionally, under the moon of the winter solstice, a procession of penitent miners carries an effigy of Cerakos II from Cerakos Gate, where the embalmed body of the mighty Emperor was cremated, through the streets of Pyr and back again. The procession represents the miners who first came upon the first Kitin nest so triggering the Great Swarming. The effigy represents Cerakos II - who gave his life creating a diversion so that many citizens could escape to the east - and commemorates all those who died during the holocaust.\n
			\n
			The procession begins at Cerakos Gate, moves down Arispotle Avenue, passes before the Emperor's residence then, taking Cerakos Avenue, travels back to Fyros Gate where the effigy is burned on the pyre. The funeral urn of Cerakos II is then delivered to the Emperor on the stroke of midnight as a symbol of continuity. And so the Emperor proclaims the beginning of the festivities in honor of the courage shown by those who have given their lives for the Fyros.\n
			\n
			It is a highly significant fact that every civilization has chosen the winter solstice to celebrate the anniversary of a new beginning on the newfound lands. This season is seen as both an homage to those who have died and as a transition, symbolized by the beginning of winter, when the earth rests before it is reborn in the spring.\n
			\n
			A universal calendar was adopted by the four civilizations in 2484 to allow better coordination in international affairs. It was devised as follows: A year is divided into four cycles of twelve months. Each month consists of thirty days divided into five weeks of six days each. The year begins in the spring, which traditionally starts on the first day of the month of Winderly.\n

			[Fyros technology is based on an intimate knowledge of fire. Centuries of observation and experimentation have led these peoples of the desert to develop techniques enabling them to increase material resistance through heat. An object is heated in fire to a specific temperature then slowly cooled in sand to toughen the fibre by reducing its brittleness. Situated behind Karavia Square in the imperial city of Pyr is the great Fyros forge. This forge was built according to the plans of the great Fyros crafter Xamus, during the reign of Leanon, and is able to temper all kinds of materials with great precision.\n
			\n
			From the very outset of their civilization, the Fyros came to associate the wild flames that often scorched their lands with the dragon of the myth. Believing the flames to be a manifestation of the dreaded dragon, the Fyros bravely confronted and then learnt to tame the flames to prevent their wild rampage.\n
			\n
			Sages under the rule of Hempios were prompted to further research to find out how to harness the destructive powers of fire. Thus it was discovered that acid on contact with air creates flames. This discovery not only shook the foundation of the myth of the Dragon but marked a turning point in Fyros mastery of fire. Indeed, this knowledge was extended to the manufacture of Fyros weapons, which are capable of blasting out fire, making the Fyros the most redoubtable warriors on Atys.\n
			\n
			The road to fire mastery however has not been without sacrifice. Indeed experimentation has triggered many fires including the Great Fire of Coriolis which ravaged the cities of Coriolis and Destranon in the old lands.\n
			\n
			Despite being capable of conjuring fire, the Fyros still conserve a natural source situated in the Burning Forest. This natural fire contains magical properties.\n
			\n
			The Fyros quest for the cause of dragonfire led to the council of sages under Krythos to form a company of miners. This long mining tradition has made the Fyros excellent harvesters, allowing them to greater knowledge in the extraction of raw materials and leading them to develop techniques which increase potential extraction time of deposits.]

			[The Legend of Oflovak Rydon - told by a Fyros merchant\n
			\n
			Oflovak Rydon had been a great traveler in the old lands and during the great Kitin swarming, he shepherded thousands of Fyros from the capital city away from danger into the wilderness. On the morning of the seventh day he went to the crest of a dune to find his bearings when a halo of light came from the heavens and a great one spoke to him.\n
			\n
			"I am Elias, the father of your condition and I will help you in this moment of need. Take your people to the east to the Ridge of Baldos where you will find a rainbow on the plain. Be swift, Oflovak ." On his bended knees, Oflovak gave his reply: "You have my word, Elias, and as long as breath shall fill my lungs it shall ring true."\n
			\n
			There was no time to lose, the wind could change direction at any moment and carry the Fyros scent to the Kitin armies that were at present traveling south. Oflovak knew the dunes like the knuckles of his hand and, true to his word, led the multitude wisely to the Ridge of Baldos where there stood the promise of Elias. The rainbow carried them far away to a haven in the Prime Roots on another land, but little did Oflovak know that there could be no return once they had passed through.\n
			\n
			By and by as more homins of every race made it to the Prime Roots with tales of horror and destruction, it became clear to Oflovak that even the rainbows would soon be destroyed by the Kitins. The remaining multitudes of homins stranded in the Kitin infested areas would never know the way to the sanctuary. But how could they be brought back? To bring anyone back means finding them first!\n
			\n
			Again the answer came from the sky, this time at night. Throughout his life travels, Oflovak had developed a love for star-gazing and could tell where the clusters would appear according to the season. In this way he concluded that the Prime Root sanctuary must be situated far to the west of the ancient lands even though many thought they were to the east, as the rainbows had been located to the east of all the homin territories.\n
			\n
			In defiance of his advancing years, Oflovak set out guided by the stars at night on the greatest trek. Every so often, aided by his apprentices, Deutheus Xaphaan and Kedgy Be'Cauny, he planted signposts that pointed the way back to the newfound lands. After many adventures, twice nearly losing his life and three full years of arduous travel, at last he came to a place he knew. The plains of Coriolis, where Fyros history had so often been made, stood before him scarred and maimed after years of Kitin devastation.\n
			\n
			He went from desert to forest, forest to lake lands, lake lands to jungle, spreading the word of the route to safe haven. I, with my parents, was among the first to take that route which opened the way for the Exodus. My greatest regret is that Oflovak Rydon, the savior of so many, never saw the rebirth of our civilization. But I sometimes fancy he is up there looking down from a cloud with Elias.]

			[Tryker relations with the Zoraï in the old lands have left deep scars in the collective memory of the Tryker people.\n
			\n
			Typical of their empathetic nature and innate gift for commerce, during the early years in the old lands the Trykers struck up a tacit agreement with the Zoraï whereby raw materials and wares could be exchanged and sold at various trading posts along the great Zoraï wall. Indeed it was the Trykers who introduced the notion of money in the form of dappers, which have since become the accepted international currency.\n
			\n
			The Trykers were prepared to put their religious differences aside in the name of peaceful transactions and financial gain. In this climate of economic confidence, wealthy villages and towns soon sprang up around the trading posts on either side of the frontier.\n
			\n
			However, Tryker confidence was momentarily shattered in 2435 with the Matis invasion of their lands. The Zoraï response to the Tryker demand for asylum was to draw up their gates to keep violence from their jungle lands, so making Tryker escapees easy prey for the Matis knights. Many thousands of Trykers were slaughtered by the Matis as a deterrent to resistance and rebellion. The rest were made prisoners and shipped back to forest lands where, disorientated, they could be easily exploited as slaves. The trade post towns were ransacked and looted.\n
			\n
			After the peace treaty of Karavia in 2437, relations gradually picked up again until 2481 with the Great Swarming of Kitins. Again the Zoraï responded to Tryker pleas for refuge by closing their gates in a bid to keep the monsters out! More recently, relations were strained again in 2504 when Fung-Tun permitted slavery in Zoraï lands under the pretext of needing extra hands to repel the goo.\n
			\n
			Despite the Zoraï ratifying the Homin Rights Act in 2518, the Tryker government understandably refuses to place its trust in the Zoraï and no longer seeks their custom. Moreover, Trykers find it increasingly difficult to relate to the Zoraï way of life which, for them, stunts individual self development and limits homin freedom of thought. Trykers also find Zoraï generally too austere and incapable, in their quest of the sublime, of taking delight in the simple pleasures and comforts that nature has to offer.\n
			\n
			In spite of past bitter feeling, in accordance with the summit of Hoï-Cho of 2516, the Tryker government allows the pro-Zoraï tribe, the Beachcombers, to reside on Aeden Aqueous.\n
			\n
			It is to be noted that the Lagoon Brothers are ferociously against Zoraï movement in Aeden Aqueous.\n

			[Seeds of Common Sense\n
			\n
			During the homin period of refuge in the Prime Roots, following the great swarming of Kitins, in their mutual suffering the four civilizations came together despite the Karavan predicating that homins shouldn't mix. Jena's disciples were no doubt worried that the survivors of the swarming would fall into discord, kill each other outright and deprive Jena of her offerings!\n
			\n
			Nevertheless, for perhaps the first time in history, homins came together to make life as best as possible for one another. We Trykers dealt with the water supply, making sure it was fresh and plentiful, the Fyros set up sentry posts and dug out chambers in the caverns, the Matis made some real comfy furniture and the Zoraïs magnetized places to ward off bad air. All in all homins made every effort to keep their grievances under their bonnets. That is, except on one particular occasion...\n
			\n
			In order to take measures to prevent a terrible bane from calling on hominkind again, there was a great debate among the homin leaders to figure out why they had been so severely punished. That was asking for trouble. It was the Fyros who started the ball rolling, as per usual, saying that they were skeptical of the Karavan and even of Jena. Because if Jena was all she was made out to be how could she have let homins be massacred in their hundreds of thousands?\n
			\n
			The Matis royal court was flabbergasted and claimed that it was talk like that that had made Jena less attentive to homin suffering, and that the Fyros ought to be more reserved in airing their infidelity. After all it was they who had triggered off the whole invasion in the first place! Besides, weren't the Karavan at present clearing the lands to enable homins to resurface? Then it was the turn of the Zoraï leader, Hoï-Cho, to put in his two dapper worth...\n
			\n
			Hoï-Cho said that the Karavan had been unable to react as they didn't have the spiritual aura of the Kamis. And if the high spiritual guardians - meaning the Kamis - did not act immediately it was because of the weak communion between them and the homin people in the wild lands at large - meaning everyone except themselves. Things were getting pretty rowdy when suddenly, above the uproar there came the sound of a great gong, and upon a pedestal there stood, as serene as the summer sun and sage as the stars, Rigan Mac'Darrell, the Tryker leader who called for silence and cupped his ear towards the main door. Everyone suddenly stopped their ruckus and listened in fear of the appalling thumping of Kitin feet... \n
			\n
			But there was no Kitin feet, just the sound of windy silence. Then the Tryker intoned these words which have since remained engraved in Tryker memory: "Let silence clear the air of discord, for in silence do the seeds of common sense grow best!" Then as if by magic there came the sound of whispers and the hushing of young voices, and... four kids, a Tryker, a Fyros, a Matis and a Zoraï, who'd been eavesdropping behind the door, fell into the debate chamber all in one block! This was followed by hearty laughter all round to what Yasson, the Matis King, raised his cup and called a toast: "Pray, let us labor mutually for our children!"\n
			\n
			Alas the short silence was not enough to seep into all homin hearts for soon after, they were able to quit the Prime Roots under Karavan assurance and protection, to once again form their own territories and rebuild their respective civilizations.]

			[The Audacity of Loria\n
			\n
			Loria was the only girl raised by a humble family of beachcombers. All day long she would play and watch her cousins spinning the logs down at the river instead of doing chores for her aunty in the lodging. Despite her aunt's scolding she always ended up down at the waterside. Bright and breezy and free as the wind, was Loria, skipping after yubo and shooting the rapids better than any boy. One fine summer's day, as she was hopping over stepping stones around Barley Bay she stumbled upon a loose stone and uncovered a pothole about two feet wide just big enough for a child of eleven to wiggle through.\n
			\n
			She ventured inside and climbed down a great sprouting root and to her surprise came upon a cavern of ancient ruins. With a pocketful of white coral pebbles she had picked along the lake shore, she set off all afternoon in exploration of the great chambers using the beautiful luminous flowers there to light her way. The following morning, instead of going to the school house she ran along to the temple and amused the elders with stories of caverns and strange luminous plants. The old sages laughed at her wild imagination but the following day she had a surprise for them.\n
			\n
			Vexed by the elder's mocking, the next day Loria took three beautiful plants to the temple. The elders could hardly believe their eyes and asked Loria to show them this cavern. On coming to the pothole the old men drew back aghast in the knowledge that she had ventured into the forbidden Prime Roots so transgressing the Law of Jena, whose disciples would be down on her like a ton of bricks if they knew. Loria was banned from going out for twenty days and the entrance was sealed with silt and clay. Her confinement taught Loria a valuable lesson and she didn't go to that pothole again, nor did she say anything when she discovered another.\n
			\n
			One day there was a terrible accident down at the lake where her cousin Bodley, having fallen and knocked his head, was dragged out of the water half drowned. He desperately needed some life seed but the family was too poor to buy any too proud to accept charity. Loria knew that sometimes the Tryker merchants sold lake flowers to the Matis who she knew would pay dearly for a rare plant with illuminating properties. She took to the Prime Roots with a knapsack full of coral pebbles to further explore the galleries leading under the great mountain which divided the vast Matis forests from the lake lands.\n
			\n
			Before long the air changed, grew cooler and had a different smell altogether. Then, reaching the dot of light at the end of a tunnel she heard a chattering in a tongue unknown to her. She took a peek out. There, in a pool of clear water surrounded by lofty trees, she spied a group of maidens bathing. By a bush she noticed some strange but beautiful clothing and couldn't resist touching the material it was made of. She picked up a large shoe to see it twinkle in the sun and inside she found the most beautiful seed box.\n
			\n
			She opened the seed box of coral and mayleaf to find the answer to her prayers, three precious life seeds. The chattering suddenly grew closer and, hardly having time to think, she pocketed the seed and left the luminous flowers she had picked as payment before dashing back to the pothole entrance. Peering from behind a bush she observed the scene and the wonderment on the faces of the tall ladies she knew now to be Matis. She realized too that she had actually traveled under the great mountain in barely two hours into the Matis territory which normally took a full week by the mountain road. Back at home she crushed the precious seeds and poured the powder into Bodley's tonic so no one would know lest she got scolded for violating the law of the upheld by Jena's disciples, the Karavan.\n
			\n
			The following morning she set off again on the journey under the great mountain. By the cool clear pool she saw the beautiful seed box open and brimming with seed. She waited till she was sure the coast was clear, that it was not a trap. She first cast the precious flowers over by the seed box, seeing no one seize them she then dashed over to fetch the seed and back again under the great mountain and home to administer the seed to her ailing cousin. There was enough seed for five days' treatment and he was beginning to recover. But then the heat wave struck and he broke into a fever. Again Loria took to the cool Prime Roots, picked some flowers and went back to the place where the Matis maidens bathed. But there was no one about. She placed a solitary flower on the usual spot in the hope that the maidens would return the next day so she might recover more seed.\n
			\n
			The following morning she set off on her journey again with her heart heavy with anguish and full of hope. To her great relief at the bathing pool she saw the seed box full to the brim with the precious seed! She hastily repeated her precautious steps then dashed over and seized the box. Only this time, as she turned back, she had to hold her hand over her mouth to stop her heart skipping out of it, for her path was blocked by an old Matis sage flanked by two maidens! Worse, two men were now creeping up behind her with a net.\n
			\n
			From what she could gather the old man was warning her that she couldn't return to the Prime Roots, for he used the words "Jena" and "Karavan" which is the same in all homin tongues, and he had the same reprimanding expression as the elders in her village. But Loria was in no mood for a lecture and threw the flowers for the maidens to catch to create a diversion, pocketed the seed box, dived through the legs of the old man and dashed as fast as she could into the bushes and down into the pothole. Once home she was able to give the precious seed to her poorly cousin who fully recovered to spin the logs many a year there after. And from that time on the family always managed to some how make ends meet. As for the seed box, Loria kept it hidden from all inquisitive eyes for she knew that some day it might come in handy... But that's another tale.]

I was just a simple scout for the Burning Spear, who had just re-formed, and I thought that all the refugees we found would be delighted by our arrival. I met a group of what I thought were normal refugees, and I led them straight to our camp. I took them through our defences, thinking that I was bringing friends. In the massacre that followed I lost my brother and my sweetheart {break}It took me a year to get over it and pull myself together... So you'll understand how much this means to me.\n
			\n
			As a thank you for this first mission, and so that you're better protected when you tackle the next stage, take this.]

			\n
			A raw material's type determines its potential uses, in other words, which parts of an item which can be made from it. Let's take an example:an oil material, regardless of its origin, can always be used to make either the explosive part of a projectile, or padding for a piece of armor. \n
			\n
			The quality of a raw material will determine the quality of the final item which it will be used to make, and is defined on a double scale: \n
			@{T5}- a @{F90F}quality@{FFFF} scale, the @{F90F}grade@{FFFF}, containing five levels: Basic, Fine, Choice, Excellent and Supreme. \n
			@{T5}- a numbered @{F90F}level@{FFFF} scale, from 1 to 250.\n

Let's take the example of the oil again: Gulatch oil will enable you to increase the damage caused by ammunition, whereas Pilan oil will enable you to craft lighter ammunition. \n
			\n
			Note: Your skill level as a craftsman doesn't limit the type, origin or quality of the raw materials that you can use. However, this same level of skill limits the quality of the item that you'll make. The quality of the created item will be no higher than the quality of the lowest level raw material used.]

Of course, as it's in their nature to want to do more than everyone else and quicker, they tried to install a system that would bring them large quantities of raw materials, without them having to lift a finger. That's when they had the brilliant idea of transforming plants into natural extractors, a brilliant idea which turned against them, and turned their city into ruins {break}A rather tragic story, which to tell the truth, makes me laugh more than cry. The Matis are crazy; they think they're better and more intelligent than everyone else. Most of them still can't admit that their experiment was a mistake. Furthermore, in the past the Matis enslaved my people. So I wouldn't give them the honor of pitying the terrible fate of their city {break}For them it's a tragedy, for me it's a windfall because those ruins are still overflowing with forgotten treasures. So it's time for you to give treasure hunting a go, you'll see, nothing is more exciting. Go and nose around in the ruins and steal everything you can.]

{
		mission_zorai_03_p_msgbox_actions	[@{W500}The stanzas that you have acquired from trainers are yours for good and you can use them as you please to make up new Actions. You can change an existing Action by right-clicking on an icon in the Action Bar, then choosing @{F90F}Edit Action@{FFFF}. You can also create a new Action by clicking on a free space and choosing @{F90F}New Action@{FFFF}.\n
			\n
			Let's take a look at an existing Action to understand how it works. Edit the @{F90F}Acid Damage 1@{FFFF} Action. The window which has just opened contains the stanzas which make up the Action. We can see two kinds of stanza: Options and Credits. The Options determine the nature, power and functionalities of your action. You can add Options to your Action using the @{F90F}Add Option@{FFFF} button. The more Options there are in your Action or the more powerful it is, and the more costly it will be in terms of @{FF0F}Option Points@{FFFF} (Points shown in @{FF0F}yellow@{FFFF}.)\n
			\n
			For your action to work, you have to balance the total number of Option Points with the total number of @{0F0F}Credit Points@{FFFF} (in @{0F0F}green@{FFFF}.) The total number of Credit Points must be equal to or higher than the total number of Option Points. \n
			\n
			So Credit Stanzas are essential to the balance of an Action even if they result in penalties: The @{F90F}Range Credit@{FFFF}, for example, reduces the range of the spell - the higher its level, the more Credit Points it adds to your Action and the shorter your spell's range will be. You can add a new Credit Stanza by clicking on the @{F90F}Add Credit@{FFFF} button. The more stanzas you obtain from trainers, the greater the number of possible combinations you'll have for your Actions. \n
			\n
			It is vital to set the limits of your Actions as your effectiveness depends on it. There is no ideal configuration for an Action, everything depends on your needs and your strategies. Here's an example: You can attribute a powerful Sap Credit to an Acid spell so that no other kind of Credit is required - your spell will have a long range and a very short incantation time but will use up lots of Sap; conversely, you can replace the Sap Credit with a powerful Range Credit, meaning that your spell can only be used at a short range, but can be used as often as you like because it doesn't cost any Sap!]

Make use of what I've just taught you: Put together a group and make sure it includes a healer magician.

Our magicians continue to open up the ruins of Silan, unfortunately they are regularly attacked by predators from the north.

			My art takes me all over the world. I have crafted Matis swords for the Fyros, and made good money out of it too.
